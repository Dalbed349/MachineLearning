For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

Here's an extract from Speigel: \"\"Copts make up the largest Christian community in the Arab world and around 8 million Egyptians belong to the Coptic Church. They're barred from high government positions, diplomatic service and the military, as well as from many state benefits. Universities have quotas for Coptic students considerably lower than their actual percentage within the population.Building new churches isn't allowed, and the old ones are falling into disrepair thanks to a lack both of money and authorization to renovate. When girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted, the police don't intervene. Thousands of pigs were also slaughtered under the pretense of confining swine flu. Naturally all were owned by Christians. The same with Luxor's massacre. For example see article Spain. It talks about bombing in commuter trains in Madrid, Spain on 11 March 2004.

I'm not quite sure what is how a notification is better than an edit to the user talk page, but I still appreciate it. I tried to reach you on Twitter (see my tweets in this conversation) but I don't appear to have got a reply. I'm glad to see you're on the Wikipedia as well.

I still kept most of the E-mail messages from him (although I'm not sure I have all of my own replies), and was sorry to have learned about him passing away (which I did after doing a web search by accident).\n",

I also want to translate (from Hebrew to English) a story I originally wrote about my Internet relationship with Adrian (see this link - not sure what Google Translate and similar services can make of it for now) for an online Israeli story contest for the Software Freedom Day, which had a focus on open source software development (I don't think I hoped to win, but I wanted to do my share for the event). The story was written back when Adrian was still alive, and we exchanged E-mails for several years after that.\n",

They only wanted those studies on adults with a specific diagnosis: \"\"Using the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder (DSM or ICD classification) and limited to include only Randomised Controlled Trials, 46 studies were excluded from the early phase.\"\" Of the four studies that remained, one was on TM.

His meta-analysis included 35 studies on TM.

      "Thanks so much for your thoughtful input to my editor review! Firstly, to answer the question you asked: I'm not sure yet if I really want to be an admin. Like I said, I've been toying with the idea, but I keep having these nagging doubts that it wouldn't be right for meI'd get carried away with my newfound powers, or I'd feel pressured by the responsibility that goes along with those powers, or I wouldn't have the time to be an effective admin anyway, or I'd spend so much of my wikitime admin-ing that I'd lose sight of actually writing and editing. So as I think of it now, mulling it over, I suppose I'm leaning against it. There is a certain \"\"prestige\"\" awarded those who are elected admins and that certainly had an attraction for methe satisfaction of earning the respect from my fellow editors, being entrusted with the special toolsbut that's no reason to seek adminship. Yeah...you and the nagging little voice in my head are probably right, adminship isn't my thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your criticisms: I know I'm naive, not to mention emotional to a fault. (as you know all too well!) There are a lot of things that should just slide right off my back but for whatever quirk in my personality, they don't. I've always been like this and probably always will beheightened emotional sensitivity is hardly a detriment to me as a musician/artist, but it definitely can get in the way sometimes in places like this. I'm learning to deal with it better, I think, just by getting more experience, but it's probably always going to be an issue for me to some extent. And to be completely fair to myself, I'm actually quite stable at the \"\"core of my being\"\" (to use a cheesy phrase) and there's very little in everyday life that can really hurt me deeply. (i.e. stuff waaaay more serious than dumb arguments on the wiki.) I haven't totally lost perspective! ;-) \n",
      "\n",
      "Your comments about my tendency to try desperately to find common ground with unreasonable editors were also spot-on; I certainly have done that but didn't quite consciously realize it until you pointed it out!! I hate the types who always go around making enemies and assuming the worst, and I always try to avoid being like that, the obvious result being that I often overcompensate and end up gullible and easily pushed-around: \"\"I'll say whatever you like, just please don't start a fight!!\"\" (I've done that most often with a certain Serbian fellow, for some reasonhoping to score brownie points and maybe win civil treatment eventually?!) Lousy foreign-policy strategy really...I'll try to do a better job of standing my ground in the future.   \n",

Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).  My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.  After the Sacks summon the clock, Crimson and LOVE throw over defeated opponents (already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff) into each number, with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the Yamiking. -\n",

Re: when speakers do make arguments to defend a usage, these arguments are often complicated by their reliance on false ideas on linguistic matters, such as the impression that an expression is newer than it really is. The reference only provides one example: \"\"accepted to college\"\". As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on \"\"linguistic matters\"\"? It is difficult to guess them solely from one example (that an expression is newer than it actually is). If the sentence were clearer, it would easier to verify it.  \"\n",

      " I know as I have not been able to find out how many amps the receiver and transmitter drew is what happened on the flight to Hawaii. We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess\"\" (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much \"\"gain\"\" they would have gotten from a \"\"less than optimum\"\" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier\"\" or 'feeble and unintelligible\"\" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.\n",

If the draw game is goalless, Italy will advance with a higher number of goals among teams in question while Spain and Republic of Ireland still tie. As reapplying the tiebreaker on the game between Spain and Republic of Ireland doesn't help, Spain will advance (with Italy) with a higher overall goal difference.

      "Hi, Cyberia.  There's actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television) and its talk page.  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it's necessary — that is, when there's no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:\n",
      "Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes \"\"Go\"\", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.\n",
      "The argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the \"\"consistency\"\" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.\n",

      "\n",
      "I admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case, but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship (with a capital \"\"S\"\") and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship (with no capitals), it's sufficiently clear.  However, if you and other BSG editors feel that it's better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page, with the episode at Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica episode) and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship, that would be OK too. — (talk • contribs) \n",
      "\n",
      "It's been considered.  See the extensive discussion at WT:TV-NC and its archives, especially here. Basically, the argument is that disambiguation isn't about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name.  So it's appropriate for \"\"The Enemy Within\"\" to be disambiguated The Enemy Within (TOS episode), since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within (disambiguation).  But there's no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated, since only the TOS episode has that name. — (talk • contribs) \n",

      "I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me \"\"foolish\"\" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would. I don't want this to be some sort of major issue in the future; I just really don't want this to happen again. Please take all of this to mind. Sorry if what I have written here is excessive, but I felt that I had a lot to say to you; thank you.  (talk) \"\n",

      "I said clearly \"\"from their understanding, rightly or wrongly, from verses in the Bible, they arive at the date and believe to be the historical\"\" date.   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by \"\"believed-to-be historical\"\", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That's not what I meant.    As far as the \"\"theological reasons\"\" the point too is why would they be so \"\"vested\"\" if they didn't believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It's all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was \"\"587\"\" instead of \"\"607\"\" (according to the whole \"\"2520 years\"\" view, which I know you don't believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we'd still be living in the \"\"last days\"\" anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the \"\"end times\"\" if that's the case.    But again, not to digress too much, I was simply answering your question, even though I thought that the discussion was already over.   You were not sure what I meant by \"\"believed-to-be historical date\"\" not just solely \"\"theological\"\".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole \"\"Gentile Times\"\" thing (as you know of course) for the whole \"\"Messiah's Kingdom\"\" breaking in for the \"\"end times\"\" etc etc.    It's whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they \"\"mis-translated\"\" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say \"\"I begin\"\" or \"\"I am beginning\"\" it does NOT say what you said of \"\"already beginning\"\".   There's no real difference between the word \"\"beginning\"\" and \"\"start of\"\".    THAT'S THE POINT.     It says \"\"I am starting off\"\".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God \"\"already started off\"\".   So?    Because in all versions the word \"\"already\"\" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word \"\"beginning\"\" or \"\"start\"\".   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are \"\"already beginning\"\" or \"\"first\"\" or \"\"starting off\"\".   Because if it's \"\"already beginning\"\" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say \"\"I am beginning with you\"\" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?  Also, again, how does your \"\"already beginning\"\" negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first?   Before other nations?     .........\"\n",

Secondly, I probably would believe such a claim if there was a in fact citation referenced in this article that is written in the English language. All we are given is an inappropriate and unacceptable reference in the form of a web page written in Russian that to English speakers, is totally useless to verify such a claim. This is English Wikipedia, not Russian Wikipedia.

And fourthly, the characterisation of Wright as radical or racist being a criticism of Obama is classic guilt by association (which even McCain pointed out).

Thus, as I said on Talk, I'm going to stick with helping Ling.Nut get his rewrite ready. I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensus-forming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions, etc. If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard, I would appreciate it. And it's probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed version(s) will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me.

      "No, Ketuanan Melayu was NEVER mentioned in the Constitution. It only mentions about \"\"Hak Keistimewaan orang Melayu\"\". This is nothing but just the mentioned \"\"Aborigin Rights\"\" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. \"\"Ketuanan Melayu\"\" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced \"\"Malays First\"\" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as \"\"pendatang\"\", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).\n",

Under the Malays First Policy (NEP, MARA, and many more) this is indeed very clear without further elaboration.\n",

The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other. \n",

For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits.

      "(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page.  See Archive 9.  The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.\n",

      "SkagitRiverQueen making unfounded accusations\n",
      "I have had to deal with this person continually since before Christmas. Someone posted questionable content to her talk page, whereupon she intitiated an unfounded sock case against me at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wildhartlivie/Archive. Then she filed a report here about me. Next she popped up at Black Dahlia, an article upon which she had never previously edited, to revert something I removed and has maintained a overly long, ridiculously drawn out discussion with editors there. At one point, Crohnie admonished her for treating her like \"\"an idiot or something\"\". Next she popped up at Charles Manson, also an article upon which she had not previously edited, to throw herself into an issue I was involved in and making unsupported statements, which she has proceeded to edit war over. She then joined WP:CRIME, a project in which I'm active. It is quote obvious she is stalking my edits. Finally tonight, another editor came to Talk:Black Dahlia to enter a content vote, and SkagitRiverQueen made an outright accusation against me of canvassing votes, where she clearly and unequivocably said \"\"It's obvious that some editors have been canvassed specifically to sway the vote (and am I making an accusation here? yes, indeed, I am).\"\" I asked her to withdraw her comment and her response was \"\"And, frankly, regardless of whether or not I can prove it, I don't believe that you *haven't* canvassed for input here.\"\" She was clearly challenged on this by LaVidaLoca here and Pinkadelica here. I want this editor to stop following me around, picking tenditious arguments and making specious and unfounded accusations against me. Wildhartlivie (talk) \n",
      "\n",
      "I endorse these comments by Wildhartlivie. I object to the specious claim that my opinion was canvassed in anyway and believe SkagitRiverQueen's intent is tenditious and assaultive in nature. For the record, she has reverted the Manson article 3 times, even after she was asked not to edit war over it. It appears to me that she is wikihounding Wildhartlivie and would take exception to anything she says or does. This is an untenable situation that needs to stop. LaVidaLoca (talk)  \n",
      "As the editor who instigated the preliminary consensus vote (and as such a possible cohort in the WP:CANVASS), I must agree that this claim against Wildhartlivie is specious and unwarranted. I have attempted to instruct SkagitRiverQueen on the proper way to engage in disputes (mainly not attacking other editors based on perceived editing style). This has not worked as of yet. I do see a pattern of \"\"wikihounding\"\" here on SkagitRiverQueen's part, as do many other editors, and this has persisted for some time. This feud must end... Doc9871 (talk)  \n",
      "IMO, this is purely retaliation by Wildhartlivie for the sock-puppet investigation (exactly why it's the first thing she mentioned in the complaint even though the issue has been over and done for nearly a couple of weeks, now). Not only is she reverting practically everything I have edited recently, she is now reverting entire sections of large articles I have edited[18]. On top of that, she continues to call me by an inflammatory name (\"\"Skag\"\" - I have noted on my User Page it is *not* an acceptible contraction of my user name; she even mentioned earlier today that she has read that admonition on my user page[19] that is a known slang term for women who have less than savory reputations[20]). Now, in addition to everything else, she has placed an \"\"edit war\"\" warning on my talk page *after* she filed this report.[21] I am not in an edit war - and am actually trying to reason with the editor of that article who has been reverting my recent edits.[22] Wildhartlivie has publically called my mental and emotional health into question here in Wikipedia on more than one occasion. Additionally, she has a questionable history that includes abuse of her rollback privileges (see User talk:Wildhartlivie for the warning she recently received and User talk:GTBacchus for her responses to the warning), continued incivility to anyone who edits articles she watches, and canvassing her Wikipedia friends to back her up whenever her edits or actions are called into question (above content from LaVidaLoca is proof of this). And yes, I do believe she canvassed editors by email regarding the issue we have been discussing at Talk:Black Dahlia. Concerning this complaint, you will likely also hear from User:Doc9871, User:Pinkadelica, User:Crohnie, User:Rossrs, User:Vidor, and User:Equazcion - all editors she has canvassed in the past when she feels she needs support in one of her efforts to prove me wrong. Evidence of this can be found at [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In those instances, she out-and-out lied that I mentioned four of those editors in any fashion - yet, her\n",

      "Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence\n",
      "Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave \"\"two rules\"\" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  \"\"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it.\"\" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)\n",
      "\n",
      "Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is \"\"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium\"\" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that \"\"hostility seemed to pervade the data\"\" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness.\"\" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)\n",
      "\n",
      "In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

Olga said afterwards that \"\"she understood no Russian.\"\" Then, in a letter to Mordvinov, she writes:\"\"Curiously, she seems to understand Russian.\"\" She said \"\"She understood no English\"\". Then Bella Cohen writes in her article in NY Times that she spoke in English to the invalid, and she answered back in English. Olga said: \"\"My nieces knew no German\"\". And we have copy of a post card written by Tatiana already in 1909 showing good knowledge of German. We have schoolbooks from Anastasia showing that she took serious lessons in German. Olga said, I knew I was looking at a stranger. But in Berlin, she said: \"\"I believe in my heart that she is Anastasia\"\", something she also repeated to Bella Cohen. She said: \"\"We showed her photos, and she did not react.\"\" Bella Cohen writes about how AA recognized Shura in a photo where Shura's face was hidden by a bell. Olga \"\"left Berlin with all hope extinguished.\"\" The very same day she writes her mother's secretary saying: \"\"How shall I tell Mama, this will kill her.\"\" (\"\"Mama\"\" would have been devastated by knowing her grandchild was alive, that would mean that the others had perished.) And she tells Frau Rathlef about how she would like to help \"\"the little one\"\", but has no money. Gilliard calls her \"\"La Grande Duchesse\"\" in front of Dr. Rudnev, and afterwords said that the woman in Berlin had \"\"nothing in common with the Grand Duchess apart from the color of the eyes.\"\" And that is after his own wife has shown him the congenital bilateral hallux valgus, the scars on the shoulder and the finger. And according to Shura, she had the same hair color \"\"with the same wave\"\". Clearly these two were lying, their own writings tell us that. , Olga wrote to the unknown woman after the visit: \"\"You are no longer alone, and we shall not abandon you.\"\" \"\"Longing to see you.\"\" \"\"I remember when we were together.\"\" Would she write this to a total stranger? Would she give her personal photo album to FS? I don't think so.

Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended.

There are two policies widely debated here, which are WP:BLP and WP:UNDUE. I am summarising opinions of the editors involved in this discussion based on the current talk page, I did not include opinions from BLP notice board and individual members talk pages. If I may have made mistakes (unintentional) in the summarisation, please feel free to remind me and I will correct. Now, while Gnangarra, Pete (Skyring), Suturz and Yeti Hunter think it is WP:BLP violation, MickMacNee, Merbabu, Orderinchaos, Peter Ballard, chaser, Lester, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont. Gnagarra and Orderinchaos believe it violates WP:UNDUE MickMacNee, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont.\n",

Even if a strict requirement for multiple sources need to be strictly followed as asserted by Gnangarra, we have more than one instance when Howard was accused of war crimes as noted in the begining of this talk page, including the head of a state. Please remember the key word here is war crime allegations not crimes. Due to these reasons, I personally think that this does not violate BLP (as with many others).\n",

I restored the cite in a less prominent position here, at which point Wehwalt added a rebuttal sentence, with edit summary \"\"added explanation of why the IDF knocked down these structures, consolidated into the Background section.\"\" I found this problematic, because the article doesn't actually say what Wehwalt added; it says that the group analyzed the claims by the IDF, and found them to be largely bogus. So, to leave Wehwalt's edit in place creates a false impression of what the HRW reports. I modified the section according, which edit was then reverted by Wehwalt. I'm going to leave it alone for a day or so to give Wehwalt the opportunity to clean it up. Incidentally, in Wehwalt's latest edit summary, he says that \"\"This is the article on Corrie, not on home demolitions.

I have no particular axe to grind with the ACLU, but on reading some of the comments on this discussion page I noticed one that said the founder was a Communist.  Clearly this is important information, as the ACLU was formed at a time when Communism was considered the pinnacle of anti-patriotism in America.  It certainly coloured my view of the organisation, and I feel it would help to bring an insight into its formation.  Yet this is not mentioned in the article.  Surely this is pertinent, given the progressive, almost anarchic, political leanings of the organisation past and present?

Assuming the former, and assuming we take \"\"this era\"\" to mean \"\"the Modern era\"\", it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine \"\"cooling off\"\" from appeals to religion until the late modern period.

      "Many thanks for your work on the Black Hawk War of 1832. I am interested in this because a few years ago I took a field trip with some people to the various historical markers in south-west Wisconsin pertaining to the Black Hawk War. The original markers would put up during President Franklin Roosevelt's administration-the New Deal. The original markers had derogatory, racist wording about the Native Americans. The state of Wisconsin to its credit installed more contemporary markers but also kept the older markers. Also I started articles about various people involved in the Black Hawk War who ended up getting elected to their state legislatures. That was interesting. Again my thanks-\n",

A separate issue then became the attacks on me from all sides led by Dave1185, to which I responded angrily.  My anger has then been used to justify the original attacks.  The issue here is still the word change.  The other issue, you can discuss elsewhere if you like.  On the word change, it still seems very simple to me.  Slavishly adopting the wording of the source is wrong.  The word \"\"said\"\" is entirely neutral, while the word \"\"explained\"\" carries connotations that the article should not be carrying.  It doesn't matter at all if the source said \"\"explained\"\".  Insisting that a word must be used because it appears in the original source makes a complete mockery of the concept of writing an encyclopaedia. The aim here is a bit higher than a massive copy and paste exercise, is it not?  Anyway, it seems to me from the source that Lee did not \"\"explain\"\" or \"\"say\"\" but the Singapore government did.  So, where it says \"\"Lee explained...\"\" it could say \"\"The Singapore government said...\"\".  This is accurate and neutral.\n",

I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T-34's lower ground pressure, and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept. to achieve similar results.

I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea.  In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps, it was Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair.  A long time staffer, McNair was a genius at organization, but demonstrated very little understanding of, or for that matter, any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield.  Had he died a year earlier, we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans.  It would have made a difference.\n",

Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\".

Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",

For example, several of the aphorisms make explicit references to Horary astrology, which is not something that Ptolemy addressed at all in the Tetrabiblos.  One of the reasons for this, among others, is that interrogational astrology (ie. horary) was not developed until the 2nd and 3rd centuries and this development occurred in India within the Hindu tradition. (See Pingree, 1996, pg. 21)  Horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of Hellenistic astrology from which Ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on, and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the Middle Ages when the various Arab and Persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the Indian, Persian and Hellenistic traditions.  So you see, even the internal evidence in the text itself with the references to horary show that this could not have been the work of Claudius Ptolemy.\n",

Thus the first imperial year was the year that Cyrus the Great acceded to the throne in 559 BC (not his birth year many years earlier). This would mean that during Gregorian year 2010 the imperial year 2569 would have begun if the Solar Hejri year had not been reinstated in 1978. Your year 2549 would imply a first imperial year 20 years after Cyrus began his reign, after he had conquered many nations, inducing their kings to bring him gifts. This would be even more arbitrary then the beginning of his reign, which is a well known year. His birth year is assigned to be two different years, either 600–599 BC or 576–575 BC. \n",

But it's not the \"\"problem\"\" criteria for SoP - for SoP the problem criteria is the control of populated territory (e.g. ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there). For example on p10/11 of the source: \"\"has a government...have a legislative body...have a judicary...have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will.\"\" - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation/control. All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is \"\"peace loving\"\", whether SoP is \"\"able and willing\"\" to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed \"\"peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations\"\" the \"\"problem\"\" criteria is whether it's \"\"really a state\"\" (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's \"\"able to carry out the obligations\"\" (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)\n",

      "David Art's book is mentioned in the article, so I think a good starting point should be what he wrote:  \"\"In this book, I use \"\"far right\"\" as an umbrella term for any political party, voluntary association, or extraparliamentary movement that differentiates itself from the mainstream right....\"\"Radical right\"\" refers to a specific type of far right party that began to emerge in the late 1970s....[T]here has been a convergence around the term in the literature....\"\" (Inside the Radical Right: The Development of Anti-Immigrant Parties in Western Europe (2011), p. 10)  He then says his definition draws from Betz (1994) and Mudde (2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "My first comment is that since Art says there is convergence on use of the term we should not use in text attribution.  We should just acknowledge that while there is no consistency on terminology, the term normally refers to the wave of right-wing parties that began to emerge in the 1970s.  We should only  use in-text attribution when someone says something original.  For example Art refers to Betz when he provides Betz's explanation of why these parties are right-wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we need to ensure that the article is about a specific topic, in this case the parties and groups that began to emerge in the late 70s, and include only comments about these parties where the author is clearly referring to them.  For example, some writers use the term radical right to refer to parties such as the BNP but not UKIP.  Other writers may not use the term radial right but may call them \"\"third wave\"\" of the Extreme Right Party family, as Mudde did in his 1996 article \"\"The War of Words Defining the Extreme Right Party Family.\"\"  Incidentally we should have an article that family too.  It's definition is similar to Art's use of \"\"far right\"\", although that term is more usually used for the more right-wing of the Extreme Right Parties, such as the BNP.\n",

He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him. When he was fighting to save cities from foreign occupations at age 30, his hometown fell to the enemy. His superior lobbied for him to be sent away to get rid of him when he was 30. He was left idle at his new location and could not get paid for months. He was in a hospital in Vienna for renal treatment confined to a bed for months lonely when he was 37. When returned to work, the army he would command was disbanded. He was fired by the Minister of Defense at age 38. He owned no civilian clothes to wear, no money saved and had to borrow a coat from a friend. An arrest warrant was issued for him the same year. A death order was issued for him when 39. He became the President of the Turkish republic when he was 42. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk read 18 thousand volumes of books in which over 200 000 lines are highlighted. Tens of thousands of sidenotes were entered. When found with red weepy eyes, he said his only worry was burning eyes which he took care of yards of soft fabric he'd ordered by his side to dry his eyes. He put his signature under the biggest changes and revolutions of his time. His farewell was equally impressive and touching with the last words of ‘.. and peace be upon you..’ in the morning of November 10, 1938 when Turkey was just waking up.\"\n",

Just to clarify what I was after with singular v. plural (so as not to appear a plodding dolt), I meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural, the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre.  A point of general interest: the other, singular pinakes listed in the Suda entry aren't considered parts of the work known as the Pinakes, that being Πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων, καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν.  I don't know that I believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments, but who am I?  Going this route, I'd actually be alright with no mention of the/any Pinakes appearing on the Pinax page: this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste, considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at Athens.

For instance, if you're Russian you may understand a Polish guy completely, but your Russian friend may have no idea what's going on. And if the Polish guy says something else, you might not understand him at all. It is very hard to study intelligibility because there is so much variation. So just because you understand (or don't understand) something in a related language it does not mean that is the case for all speakers (or even most speakers) and it definitely does not guarantee it goes the other way around.\n",

People should respect that and not try to convert me to this religiousless world. Anyway. I don't reject all of evolution. Like, I wouldn't argue against organism adaptations or reject evolutionistic writings (I am actually busy reading a great pro-evolution book at the moment, \"\"Biology (Seventh Edition)\"\", by  various editors. It's this University book or something). Well. What I am countered against most is the hypothesis of the big bang. But I will not start to argue here again.

I could take the liberty and not agree with you that I have given a proposal at all, exactly because of my act (without any prior discussion about it) given, and if so, I could conclude that then there was nothing to reject in the first place. Not to mention that the terms overwhelming or even majority are to the least inappropriate, if not even biased.

Since, the term project inherently has no attributes of obligation - if not even posesses a certain quality of casualness - I might considered the term has quite different characteristics.

      "In an effort to avoid any future edit war, I wanted to discuss why I feel that the lead should be changed. As I've noted previously, the citations given for rap metal repeat links sourced later in the article. The reason that punk rock had been given as a genre was because it was the most commonly used term given in articles about the band, rather than rap rock, a term that is not used by the band. While it has been argued that Rolling Stone is a stronger source than some of the others, it should be noted that these reviews were written, as previously noted, during the period in which the band was signed to a major label, when the band received more coverage than it has while recording and releasing albums independently, and sources agree that the majority of the band's works (its debut EP, debut album, and all independent releases) reflect a punk influence, rather than a metal influence, and most certainly the band's most recent work is considered to be punk-influenced. Thus, taking into consideration that the majority and most recent of the band's works is considered to be punk rock, I feel that this is the genre that should  be given in the lead. (  )\n",

Then a short summary can be provided summarising the info on each country-specific page (which, as I mentioned above re: Germany, will tend to remain on-topic and will become good references for the Energy transition efforts in each county over time, blah blah.)

However, if you have a specific reason to object to another article's existance (other than \"\"my article was deleted so this one should be deleted too\"\") then you need to tag it with {{subst:afd}}. That produces a tag that gives you access to the AfD process. Follow the red link it creates and on that new page add {{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | text=Reason}}~~~~ where PageName is the name of the article (case sensitive) and Reason is your detailed reasoning why the article should be deleted. Finally, go to WP:AfD. There's a link marked \"\"Add a new entry\"\". Click that link and, at the bottom of the page, add {{subst:afd3 | pg=PageName}} where PageName is is the name of the article (case sensitive).

Likewise `nx (\"\"living\"\") here is an active participle, probably perfective, so the reconstruction of this should be *ʕa:nəx, including the effect of posttonic vowel neutralization (Loprieno, 1995). As for \"\"jama:n\"\", Loprieno indicates that the change j > ʔ before an unstressed vowel began in the early Middle Kingdom. This suggests that jama:n was realized as ʔama:n by the time of Tutankhamun.  I therefore propose the reconstruction of his name be changed from *tuwt-ʕankh-jama:n to *tVwa:t-ʕa:nəx-ʔaˡma:n, where V is a vowel of undetermined quality.

      " Hello, Callmemirela! It is nice to meet you. Your help in improving the page for Criminal Minds (season 11), specifically the episode section, is much appreciated!I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you. Criminal Minds is, by far, my favorite show and I love to help keep fellow fans informed.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in my entire time editing Criminal Minds pages - which has been a little while; while I am fairly new to Wikipedia, this account was created with the (2) at the end because my previous account of the same name was inaccessible because I forgot my password lol - I have not once, by any editor, been asked/required to provide refernces for the production codes. Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references! But the production code is usually confirmed in one of the references whether it be title, writer, director, air date or any combination therein, added to the fact that the air dates can help determine the order in which the episodes will air, they are almost always confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, I have come to understand there can be an exception in which the production codes can serve quite useful! This is when episodes air out of order, an example of which would be in Season 10, 1006, \"\"Boxed In\"\", was aired before 1005, \"\"If the Shoe Fits\"\", because \"\"Boxed In\"\" was the Halloween episode and it was scheduled to air on 11/05 whereas \"\"If the Shoe Fits\"\" was scheduled to air on 10/29; to resolve this, they merely switched their air dates, however, the production codes remained the same, therefore letting people know that they were aired out of order to accommodate Halloween. In that case, I believe it was briefly required to include references with the production codes. That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've posted references for all of the upcoming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by denoting the summaries in a vernacular (lexicon; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and/or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it!) very seriously!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have aired in order, thus far, and we (the fans) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to scheduling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing!\n",

      "Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  \n",

Yet in the case of this wiki page, the whole category of publications written and published from Waldorf/Waldorf-related sources is being excised. So, what do you do? WP:SCHOLARSHIP suggested to me that you go with a third-party source but maybe something else is better? Thanks.\n",

      "Regarding references, I don't think you need to include a citation after every sentence, as long as they're not direct or indirect quotes, and/or potentially controversial in any way.  This is especially true if a whole paragraph comes from a single source in that case, I just put a single citation marker at the end of the paragraph.

      "Good afternoon DreamGuy. I would like to reply to the message you left me since I could not do so privately in e-mail. Please feel free to delete this whenever you are through with it. I rather think posting those links in commercial and personal spaces are acceptable and based on the rules of Wikipedia are not out of line. If posting them on all sub-links of Savannah as points of interest is wrong, I am sorry, but it seemed pertinent to me, especially since there is hardly any other information on those pages. I did not “spam” (as you say) any links on pages that were not somehow directly related to the subject of the links. Why you chose to pick those two links, out of many commercial and non-commercial links on the pages to dispute, I have no idea. I am sorry if you have a problem with ghost books but this one is directly related to Savannah, Georgia so it seems to me that this link would be the last one you would erase off the Savannah page. Having reviewed the “spamming” page link it seems to me that spamming would be on a much larger scale that the links I posted. If you would like I can move all of them to the bottom, if this appeases your mind. I also linked them in the external links section, this is not like I cut into every paragraph of the articles and inserted the link. I actually thought it might be of interest to people who happen to enjoy ghosts. I am not even in the employ of Cobblestone Tours or even James Caskey himself, I just thought (as a local Savannah resident who has read the book, taken the tour, and is a fan) that I should point more people who are interested in this sort of thing to the stories and experience. However, feel free to remove links that are not pertinent, if you so choose, but articles related directly to Savannah’s ghosts, I feel, are not in that category.  In the future though, if you would like to continue this discussion, feel free to send me an e-mail, this information should be available to you as I filled it out when I registered.\n",

      "I am sure that clarity would help; if only we could agree as to what one would say. The knub of the disagreement comes in the relationship between Acts and the letters. Long arguments have already taken place between those who, supported by scholars such as Conzelman, think Acts to have a comparatively low historical value, emphasising the hostility towards Judaism expressed in Galatians, and those who regard Scripture as consistent de fide so that any one statement must be reconcilable with any other. Critical scholarship makes the second view difficult to hold, though it is represented in the article. the statement about St. Paul's prctice would be controverted on precisely these grounds by a number of editors and, more important, by scholars. It is always hard for editors to cope with the fact that we are not, as a matter of WP policy in a position to say that anything is 'indefensible. That is POV - a point of view. We can say that this learned person or that has argued in this way or that.

However, the general gist is that the American manufacturers went off down a technological blind alley with the big pushrod V8s and got sucker-punched by the fuel crisis, while BMW, Mercedes, and the Japanese managed to crank out as much power from more fuel-efficient overhead cam straight sixes. There's probably a better way to put it.

      "Some parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now, though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of 1956: Crosby’s character sings a love song to an eleven-year-old girl (his ex-wife’s younger sister who still has quite a crush on him);  the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughter's body (while upbraiding her for having no compassion, as most characters in the movie have already or soon will);  and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex (separated from the movie-going masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of, or by necessity having to interact with the Newport upper class). When Tracy Lord (played by Kelly) awakens hungover on her wedding day, she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing, but comes to believe she “made love” with Mike the reporter (played by Sinatra) and discusses it at length with her ex-husband Dexter (played by Crosby). At the time, of course, \"\"making love\"\" was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. Being a romantic comedy, “High Society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.\n",

But there are alot of singers who have sung in the whistle register a frequently like Betty Wright is known as the starter of the whistle register which she hits in Babysitter, No Pain, No Gain, and After The Pain. Amel Larrieux hits F#6 in For Real and in the first track of her new album she hits like E6 or something I didn't check it though. Shanice and Debelah Morgan also do it frequently and are compared to Mariah in their skill at it. Such as Shanice's overall voice and Debelah's enunciation in it. I'm pretty much all the information you'd need if you ever want to know such information on a singer. And I made the list cause I don't trust people. Like people always get notes wrong. Like Blu Cantrell's B6 is really Bb6. And Whitney Houston has actually hit G6 but some say its A6. She seemed to have done it by accident though.

For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.\n",

      "A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.\n",
      "\n",
      "A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    \"\n",

They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.

Could you be a little more specific about what you feel the problem areas are? The tag you used implies that the problem is that there are references, but they're not inline citations - but they're all inline already. Your edit summary said that it should have more footnotes, by which I assume you mean references cited. I know there's no hard and fast rules about that stuff, but six isn't too bad for a start-class article and every paragraph is supported by at least one reference, so I'm thinking there must be something specific that you feel isn't covered adequately. Could you elaborate a bit (here, or maybe the article talk page would be better)? Most articles on WP could use a few more references, but article tagging is usually reserved for articles with sections of material that are entirely unreferenced or when there's specific concerns like BLP, neither of which I think is the case here.\n",

The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from \"\"This erroneous nomenclature\"\" and the preceding paragraphs.

However, it also would eliminate a great many true credentials claims, and the underlying premise of the proposal is that true claims are beneficial.

Give Donohue (which essentially is the Catholic League) credit as he is a seasoned p.r. and talk show veteran and seems to know what hot buttons to push and how. However if we are going to give him a platform I would feel better if we broke down the section into the major points with balancing statements so the readers can easily see the issues dissected and addressed. To me the section feels like a several-headed beast each adding a sentence onto the next with the net result of confusion. I suggest sections including one devoted to just the League's issues (if it's just them) so we don't infer because the League said X then Y happened. In my opinion Donohue speaks as if he's representing Catholics and is actually seen by many Catholics as an extremist (I'm not sure if right-wing is accurate) who's actually feeding anti-Catholicism by perpetuating stereotypes in pop culture arenas while ignoring concerns of mainstream Catholics. I may not be wording this in the best way but I think the gist is there. Benjiboi\n",

The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.\n",

Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.\n",

It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous.

So, anyone can put up any infobox they want. I don't see much of a value in such infoboxes. I like to form my own opinion based on the particular user's edits and comments only. Looking at the edits and comments of some of the folks who do have infoboxes...... Actually, to my way of thinking, there is no need for such infoboxes. Things become easily obvious from edits and comments alone. I do not say anything about your edits and comments because I think I am unqualified to make an assessment for your contributions. I think I have known some fine scholars on WP and have participated in some exhilarating discussions with them. But invariable, I find their userpages without any infoboxes saying it. Why does one need state the obvious? Actually, I think there are some disadvantages to putting up such infoboxes. If you are seriously considering putting up one, I think you may want to know my detailed view on it in beforehand. Looking at some of your comments, I have the most unmistakable impression that you have an excellent grasp of such issues. I have known very few users about whom I could say the same.

It is about some other, unrelated article. But since you are busy now, I don't think it would be proper for me to bother you with some silly request of mine.  I have noticed that the catalyst with sidekicks is happy because they have been able to drive you away.  Actually, it seems to me that they have driven away hundreds of users and also caused blocks on scores of others, are experts at harassing others with warnings, long winded arguments, irrelevant comments, severe ad hominem attacks, etc. etc. etc. also know how to obtain blocks for their opponents at ANIs.....

Thus the information is directly on point (not random) as regards legal analysis and adds considerably to readers' understanding of legal bias and ethical standards.

As far as I know, we are allowed at Wikipedia to create our own wikitables to display fully referenced data, which it indeed was in my latest version of the data table. I admit at first to have uploaded unsourced \"\"Monthly reference value data\"\" that strived against WP:OR, which was something I only did as part of a process, in the hope for other editors (or myself) at a later stage being able to find direct sources for those values. Yesterday, I indeed managed to find a direct source for these monthly values published by the Polish Ministry of Finance. Please take into consideration, that we do not have 2 equal WP:PS for the same data but only have 1 (The Polish source), as I have managed to proof here at the talkpage that the Latvian source do not qualify for the purpose, as it did not strictly follow the published official \"\"ECB evaluation method\"\" (which it by the way funny enough also never claimed it did) - but instead has adopted its own data approach. Please also consider, that my uploaded data table with monthly data in principle can stand alone, even without that we mention the debated report by the \"\"Latvian Central Bank\"\", as I have prooved here at the talkpage they utilised another data approach than the official \"\"ECB method\"\". After I now have ellaborated on the details, do you then have a different opinion whether or not my most recent version of the uploaded material still shall be classified as WP:OR?\n",

      "The reason why I think it is so important that we in the Latvian article display monthly convergence values for each month for the past year, and why inclusion of this material shall not be disquallified as per WP:NOTSTATS, is because the uploaded monthly data (for the most recent 12 months) reflect how the official \"\"ECB method\"\" works, as a graphical illustration which help casual readers to grasp that all candidate countrys have been granted the right by EU to apply ECB for conducting a monthly convergence check at each month during the year (if they belief to have met all criteria). Unfortunately ECB do not automatically publish monthly convergency reports during the year (because in that case we would obviously have used their direct data for the table instead). But as I already provided evidense for, the Polish Ministry are publishing monthly reports where they check for monthly convergence and calculate the ECB reference value limits based on the official \"\"ECB method\"\" (which proofs this is notable stuff), and their findings in the Polish context has also been covered over at the Polish wikipedia (although by a much lower quality than my attempt).

In fact, it got a lot of ink in Greil Marcus' Invisible Republic/Old, Weird America and I can't remember off the top of my head if Clinton Heylin talks about it a lot, but I always thought it was quite famous in its own right as one of the \"\"great, unreleased\"\" Basement tracks.

      "A merger is probably a good idea.  First, the prehistoric man article is terrible.  In fact it shouldn't exist as anything other than a stub.  The term \"\"Prehistoric man\"\" is no longer used by scholars and hasn't been since the 1970's becuase it is androcentric and because there really is no such thing as a group or type of people who are characteristically \"\"prehistoric\"\".  In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.  Further, the term is Eurocentric and based on the notion of progressive stages of \"\"mankind\"\" like the \"\"stone age\"\".  There are people who still use stone tools.  The \"\"ages as stages\"\" concepts have long since been abandoned in the social sciences since they do not apply universally and can not be tied directly to other political and social developments around the world.  So I say Merge the two articles and cut the outdated garbage.\"\n",
