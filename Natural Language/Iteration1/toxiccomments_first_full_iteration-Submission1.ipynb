Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

The first paper I reference essentially addresses the issue in an interesting, and I think correct, way. I did look at the FWBO article you mention and list it as an external source and I think one of the references (essentially favourable) I supplied came from there.

      "I'm pretty sure that it's fine, if the rates are understood to be per year (or some other finite period), as is usually the case in economics.  After a year in the bank, an amount of money M becomes M*(1+i), where i is the nominal interest rate.  You can also write this as M*(1+r)*(1+p), where r is the real interest rate and p is the rate of inflation.  Then you get the first equality for r.  It reduces to i - p when p is small, or if the rates are measured instantaneously (something that probably only a mathematicians would do). -\n",

      "\n",
      "I have been bold enough to remove the following text from the Criticism section: \"\"In 1944, Tito signed a the decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property, without compensation, of Yugoslavia’s ethnic Germans” [73] and “an additional law, promulgated in Belgrade on February 6, 1945, cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans” [74].\n",
      "Reasoning: \n",
      "1) It's culled directly from a text written by Sunić for the IHR here; \n",
      "2) As we have seen previously with other parts of the Criticism section, it makes a complete dog's breakfast of the facts. There was no \"\"additional law\"\". The AVNOJ decree of 21 Nov 1944 was passed into law by the Belgrade decision of 6 Feb 1945. It was the same thing. If you are interested, what the AVNOJ decision actually said was this: \"\"‘Decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership, on state administration over the property of absent persons, and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities’. Article 1 of the mentioned decision states precisely the status of ethnic Germans: \"\"To be transferred into state ownership on the day this Decision becomes effective: 1. All property of the German Reich and its citizens situated on the territory of Yugoslavia; 2. All property owned by persons of German nationality, with the exception of those Germans who were members of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan formations, or are citizens of a neutral country who displayed no animosity during enemy occupation; 3. All property of war criminals and their accomplices, with no regard to nationality....\"\". Full details can be found here; \n",
      "3) It's untrue that Nov 44 decree/Feb 45 law \"\"cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans\"\" - this happened later, in the summer of 1945, through their loss of voting rights. Specifically, the Provisional Plenary Assembly of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia passed a citizenship law on 23 August 1945 which stipulated in article 16 that members of those nationalities “whose states had taken part in the war against the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and who, during or before the war, by disloyal  behaviour, had violated the national and public interests of the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and hence their duty as citizens thereof”, could be deprived of their Yugoslavian citizenship - it's here; \n",
      "4) It's quite hard to see how any of the stuff in question here can be converted into criticism of Tito.   \"\n",

Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.\"\"\n",

He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables.

This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science \"\"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD\"\". According to Menninger (p. 400): \"\"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land \"\"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden.\"\" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression \"\"50 wreaths of flowers\"\" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity.\"\" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, \"\"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century.\"\" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.  \n",

Among progressive ideological PACs, it ranked fourth behind America Coming Together, EMILY's List, and MoveOn.org.  The group's long time Executive Director Kelly Young left the organization in 2007.

While it would be inappropriate to examine the specific details of Rydberg's private life, his basic sexual orientation is a matter of absolute unanimity among all scholars and reference works that have considered the subject, and is an important aspect of Rydberg's life that should not be whitewashed or swept into the closet.  I would welcome a good-faith attempt by anyone to cast this material in a more acceptable light, as was suggested regarding the Thomas Mann article.

And when the subject becomes notable you'll be able to rename (\"\"move\"\") them to the titles you want. It's an easy way to get around the requirement for notability. So don't worry, you can still write the article on this subject and have it on Wikipedia, just in a different place. I hope that suggestion helps. Best regards  \"\n",

Editors are explicitly forbidden to base articles or edits on their opinions. It's the sources which count.

How do we know he doesn't have a lifespan of over a hundred years. He has certainly lived for more than that long even if he has been killed on the odd occasion. He had already lived for a century or more in Wind Waker. Furthermore I think Kaiju is debatable. The term Kaiju is Japanese for \"\"strange beast\"\" and as Ganon is indeed a strange fictional beast of Japanese origins he could be classed as a Kaiju. The Kaiju category is pretty much the same as the Fictional monsters category but it can also encompass creatures in mythology as well as fiction so by those standards I think the Loch Ness Monster and the classic European Dragon could be classed as Kaiju.   \"\n",

A government making unsubstantiated accusations at a country they're at war with may be \"\"official\"\", but it's unimportant for an article about a weapon. The type of missile used in this alleged attack is of no importance, and the fact that they even mentioned the Iskander specifically points to obvious political motivations in the accusations (ie. your're using your shiny new hi-tech weapon to destroy civilian infrastructure, shame on you!) This sort of political bickering has no place in the article in my opinion. There are specific articles and sections to put government propaganda.

I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.

First, the basis of the website is the VoteMatch quiz (I'll be adding a paragraph about that next weekend for the Notability discussion)  that is based on a Libertarian Party favorite called the Nolan Chart. Unlike the Nolan Chart, which is arranged as a [[push poll] to promote libertarianism, we arrange VoteMatch so that conservatives and liberals have the same number of \"\"yes\"\" answers. Furthermore, if you look at who OnTheIssues covers, it scrupulously includes liberals, conservatives, libertarians, greens, and far more right-leaning AND left-leaning candidates than the mainstream press does. FYI, I get incoming email accusing OnTheIssues of being left-leaning about as often as an accusation of being right-leaning. My response is always to challenge the write to find better coverage of right-leaning candidates on Fox News, or to find better coverage of left-leaning candidates on CNN  the mainstream media on BOTH sides cover their OWN candidates' issue stances less than OnTheIssues does! If that's \"\"leaning\"\", then I guess OnTheIssues leans  but I'd call it \"\"good journalism!\"\"   23:08, 4 March 2014\"\n",

That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.

      "Hello Attilios! First, thanks for your appreciative comments! I certainly plan to complete and bring the rest of the Isaurian period article to the same level, and then probably do the Amorian period too, for they are perhaps the most under-appreciated periods in the Empire's history. The other periods also need lots of work of course, but it will be some time before I will be able to do anything about that. I've got a couple of dozen ongoing projects or other articles I want to do, so time is short. Any help you can offer will, of course, be appreciated, be it pointing out an unclear sentence or a mistake, or adding some important point you feel I overlooked. Just be bold and edit. Since Byzantium is an area where only a handful of editors are active, IMO, if you can go ahead and write up even a sketchy, rudimentary outline on some of these topics (e.g. the horribly short Byzantium under the Justinian dynasty), you'd be helping a great deal. And if you can bring some respectable Italian sources in, that'd be a further bonus.\n",

The whole purpose of a stub is to act as an invitation to create an article.  Frequently, it is difficult to tell whether the subject is encyclopedic.  I have seen many good articles start as stubs.  For example, a stub may start as \"\"John Q. Unknown was an American politician\"\" and it may turn out that he was a Territorial governor, U.S. Senator and later president of a well known college.  Unless the subject of a stub is very well known, it is a rare stub that gives enough detail to know immediately whether the subject has the potential to become encylcopedic.\n",

You see, Aleta ,  I am a human not god. it's question of creditability  not only mine but also of an entity – identity  in question. I provided all the facts what so ever was demanded by wikipedian editors or opposers. But without investigating /verifying my news/reviews on Sonee , the administrator ruthlessly  deleted it under influence of  4-5 people. Have they kept  two lines over there on the person in question. I would had not raised my voice. Frustration & fighting for my democratic rights are two different issue. You can put me in any slot. It’s your view and mind. However ,  This might be an inspiration from  Sonee to me or person like Gandhi where person has to fight his  battle alone. Without dying no body can enjoy heaven. I have learnt form such people –if  you  are certain to certify self  reasoning or common sense considering it  ethically right then  least care what might the world think of you. One should act and speak right. & that’s what I am doing here. Few people have label my writing as soap box, unreliable etc… God bless them. They don’t know  about the person what revolution his voice is going to influence the world in future. Jesus, Kabir  did not changed the world in a day. No wikipedia was there then to suppress such voices or sharing their info. Strangely Good or  ridiculously bad human one day are in scripted in history. May be Jesus or Bin Laden. So my suggestion to you as a well wisher is never leave your good deed, Person like Graeme & You are rare angel breed. I can feel from my inner sense of little wisdom . I may or may not raise the page on Sonee as my mood is very upset @ present, but ever if couple of you angels feel to raise Sonee page once again any of  your good selves can go contribute for the betterment of world welfare deeds.  Try it. You will get a peaceful sleep. Because real angels never sleep unless they help a true person in difficulty successfully. They don’t leave the victim in middle of ocean.  I am fed up putting my points clicking reading all wiki pages. I  have gone mad to convince them. It’s just writing on sand.  So,  If your instinct feel Sonee deserve two line after reading below talk page of Graeme & Keeper76  feel free to raise a para on Sonee. That is enough for my satisfaction.  Read the following links & forward my voice to the ‘Chief Arbitrator Section’ or chair persons directors who run this wiki show biz.\n",

Wouldn't it be simpler to explain what it means and why it's important to their favorite TV show - since it is the most important factor to whether a show stays on the air or not (demo ratings indicate what portion of adults 18-49, the segment of the population most desired by advertisers, watch a particular episode.

Ratings are reported by every major news media, even US Today reports the 18-49 rating, so obviously many do know what it means.

Perhaps the reason there is so much more support for GW than global cooling in the 70's is that information and studies are so much more available these days.

As I mentioned at the drawing board, you might want to look for a Wikipedia:WikiProject to see if you can get assistance there. I typically do not write articles on businesses and would not unless I was 100% sure the company I was considering met our notability guidelines for companies as demonstrated through widespread, significant references in secondary sources. At Wikipedia:WikiProject Companies, you have a chance to find editors who are experienced in such matters who might be willing and able to craft such an article. That said, I see that they recommend on their talk page that you post your request at Wikipedia:Requested articles/Business and Economics/Businesses and Organizations.

My point is a logical one only.  Also, do you agree with my comments on the GW talk page where I argue for more explanation of the reasons scientists believe in GW.  Also a better definition of GW. Is it (a) the fact that instrument temperatures are on average higher than a century ago (b) a process that underlies that fact (c) the hypothesis that the process has an anthropogenic cause?  These are all different things. (a) could be true because of random fluctuations (b) could be true if the process were a natural one.

      "Guitar parts in hardcore can be complex, technically versatile and rhythmically challenging.[25] Guitar melody lines usually use the same minor scales used by vocalists (although some solos use pentatonic scales).[25] Some hardcore punk guitarists play solos, octave leads and grooves, as well as tapping into the various feedback and harmonic noises available to them. The guitar sound is almost always distorted and amplified, creating what has been called a \"\"buzzsaw\"\" sound.[26] Hardcore bassists use varied rhythms in their basslines, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines that would be hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick.[25] Some bassists emphasize a very technical style of bass playing. Some hardcore punk drummers play fast D beat one moment and then drop tempo into elaborate musical breakdowns the next. Drummers typically play eighth notes on the cymbals, because at the tempos used in hardcore it would be difficult to play a smaller subdivision of the beat.[25] ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC. 73.193.195.69  \"\n",

      "Suburb does not mean rural, it means residential. \"\"North of the city\"\" is not particularly informative in the context of this article, nor is it important enough for the lead section of this article which is a biography covering  her whole life and career. The fact that the area is a suburban part of the Tucson metro area has some informative value for our readers as it suggests the kind of connection it has to the city of Tucson, and informs our readers of the nature of the area = that it is a residential area, not a downtown business area, not the countryside, not an inner city area, etc.  \"\"Unincorporated\"\" as you added to the daughter article is a political distinction and similarly not particularly informative in the context of this article.   The wikilinked article on Casas Adobes refers to it as being suburban, as well. So, I am taking it out of the lead where it is not needed and putting into the body where it has some value.

      "Having come to power saying that her agenda was to pare down Wasilla to ‘the basic necessities, the bare bones’, she surprised its citizens when she redecorated the mayor’s office at a reported cost of $50,000 salvaged from the highways budget; its new red flock wallpaper matched her bold, rouge-et-noir taste in personal outfits. Another $24,000 of city money went on a white Chevy Suburban, known around Wasilla, without affection, as the mayormobile. She hired a city administrator to deputise for her in the day-to-day running of Wasilla’s affairs and employed a lobbyist in DC to wheedle lawmakers into meeting the town’s ever-expanding list of claims for congressional ‘pork’ (so named from the antebellum custom of rewarding slaves with barrels of salt pork). That expenditure, at least, paid off: during Palin’s six-year tenure as mayor, the federal government doled out more than $1000 for every man, woman and child in Wasilla. Her pet project was a $14.7m ice rink and sports complex, which opened in 2004. It is said to be lightly used, it has left the city servicing a massive debt, and a Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit continues over the bungled way in which Palin acquired the land on which it’s built.TABCut, Kill, Dig, Drill London Review of Books Vol. 30, No. 19, 9 October 2008, pages 7-10, Jonathan Raban 24.17.191.27  \n",

I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn't a pilot episode of TAGS).  \n",

      "I added some new content but I did not remove existing content because I figured this restructuring was such a major change that I figured to take one step at a time.   Please note that I did not move everything.  All content that was not moved (most of it) was left where it was but the section was renamed \"\"Commentary\"\".  I did not want to change too much all at once.  Much of that content is indeed commentary (not strictly factual) but some of it is still needs to be moved to more appropriate sections or deleted if duplicate information.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn't know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn't add any duplicate information.

It is, and has always been, located at List of Andy Griffith Show episodes.  Please notice that the mistake is that the word \"\"The\"\" was missing from the title (The name of the show is \"\"The Andy Griffith Show\"\").  Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word \"\"The\"\" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show's article.  However when I tried this I was surprised to discover that I couldn't do that because another article was already named List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes (with the \"\"The).\n",

Because it was always public more different people have worked on it.  The newer article is almost as old but it was \"\"hidden\"\" in a user area until just this month.  I will admit that the newer article looks nicer in style, structure, colors, etc. but IMHO I think the descriptions are better in the older, public list,\n",

      "Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:\n",

      "Bulk groups of products like the \"\"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques\"\".\n",
      "Do not include real-world products like \"\"English Muffins\"\". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.\n",
      "The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:\n",
      "Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added \"\"Radioactive Man Comics\"\", \"\"The Springfield Shopper\"\" and \"\"Li'l Bastard Kits\"\". These are great ones, but things like \"\"Disemboweller IV\"\" needn't be included.\n",

I can speak it, but that doesn't mean I know much about it.  People don't seem to understand this concept.  Also, personal experience doesn't mean anything on Wikipedia, no matter how true or false it is.  It's called \"\"original research\"\" here.  There's no need to get angry about this stuff; it's just linguistics; it's not like anyone insulted your mother or your cat or whatever you hold dear.  Keep in mind also that it is possible to live in a region one's entire life and not speak with the accent associated with that region, i.e., some people in the South have accents that are more similar to those of the West or Midland.  The same might be true for the Inland North.  Read this.  Specifically read p. 139 where it says Transitional Cities.  It explains this a little bit, though not as much as I would want it to.  Maybe you can find a more in depth explanation elsewhere, like in the real Atlas of North American English.  That's all I have to say.   \"\n",

      "Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means \"\"someone should write an article about them\"\". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.\n",
      " Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.\n",
      " You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.\n",
      " Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make \"\"corrections\"\" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to \"\"get the rest of the story out\"\", or \"\"build your brand\"\" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.   \"\n",

      " I agree. I have had a small amount of time this evening to do a little research. This 2010 review  could perhaps help in bridging the void. It states that there is a \"\"lack of consensus\"\" and \"\"robust evidence\"\" within the medical literature for things such as penile cancer, STI and UTI, while maintaining there is evidence for HIV prevention (at least in the African trials). If I had the time I would be tempted to run a statistical analysis on the medical reviews themselves! I suspect there would be a clear correlation betweeen the conclusions reached and the country from which they originated. Which brings us (in my opinion) to the crux of the matter. Rightly or wrongly, this is primarily a ritualistic or cosmetic procedure, regardless of what evidence or opinion the medical community has, or will provide. Therefore, to treat this as almost an entirely statistically based article, while only giving a cursory nod to the ethical debate, just feels wrong to me. I am certainly not advocating any bias either for or against. I would be happy to see quotes from Rabbis, Imams, surgeons and scholars. I also believe that any medical consensus (if proven) should remain the basis of the article. Perhaps a sub-heading of \"\"controversy\"\" may be worthwhile? \"\n",

I mean they use those characters at all the other Six Flags parks so it doesn't make since that the company would remove them.

      " You bet! I indeed am frustrated disappointed or should I disheartened and disgusted. Not because of the block though. It's because of the spiteful, hateful and downright vindictive behaviour some people have in wikipedia and with profound connivance of some administrators even. Mihaiam is a sock of Edward321 just look at their contributions for past 24 hours. Why should I be involved be anymore editing (although I really want to) when I know that some daft hater may simply revert ALL of them without caring much about silly things like justification or consequence and I will be blocked as a result? I shouldn't be involved. Wikipedia, like any other bureaucracy, is ruled by bullies (including some administrators). However, the real bureaucracies do give you a chance to settle the dispute in court or police station. And at least you can afford to not be so helpless about it. Here my edits were labelled as propaganda (implying that I'm a propagandist) after all my edits were rashly reverted (although they had the chance to simply modify inaccuracies with good sources, they chose to delete the whole section), nothing was done and because nothing was done, the reversion of my edits only accelerated (now, if not all, most of my edits are entirely reverted).  Then that genius John wrote on my talk-page  I'm edit-warring? I usually specifically mention (no edit-war intended) after my edit, in description. My friggin edits are getting reverted and I'm the one he deemed to be the edit-warrior? Come on now, will you. You don't want to help me. Frankly, I don't know what you want. Have a beautiful time here at the wikipedia. Humanity is withering away much faster here at the wikipedia than in the real world. The real world is sick in my view. But, in comparison to the demented arrangement here at wikipediaBecause here it every time sometimes  gratuitously comes down to majority of consensus, no matter how ignorant and/or prejudiced and/or oblivious the involved editors are about the topic at hand, their views still count. That's not a very efficient way, that is rather a crazy medieval way of discerning what's reliable and what's not. And thus, implies that minority is always wrong and majority is always correct. That's fundamentally incorrect., real world seems like a much better place to dwellAlthough I concede that some (few) of my sources too were questionable and faced justified skepticism, I don't think that it necessitated a whole reversion. Slight modifications would have worked just fine.. Thank God science doesn't progress like that in real world.  (Talk?)  \n",

The exact conditions as to how they died have been examined by both the police and the public prosecutor and at subsequent civil trials - the conclusion of these determines that it was an accident. Many people fell down, which often happens at big concerts, but at one place they did not get up again. Some crowdsurfers fell into this \"\"hole\"\" and are believed to have been factors of the event turning wrong (crowdsurfing was subsequently forbidden across most of Europe). The people at the bottom died of suffocation. When the security guards in front of the stage got to the area after the music had been stopped it was too late. In the following year, the accident led to massive changes with regards to safety to avoid similar situations - not just at Roskilde Festival, the security conditions for festivals everywhere in Europe changed. Before the accident in 2000, Roskilde Festival was considered one of the safest festivals, and yet the accident happened there. Many other festivals have smaller safety systems than Roskilde Festival and revised their procedures even further. For instance, Glastonbury Festival in England chose to cancel its festival in 2001 to have enough time to reorganize the safety planning since the festival in 2000 was not at all at level with Roskilde Festival. Each year Roskilde Festival makes an extensive health and safety assessment which the festival is executed on the basis of.

      "Hello, Tgeorgescu... It was correct what you added, sourced, and valid what you put in, according to context, and according to WP due and undue and sources.  Your edit and addition were valid and correct, and arguably warranted, and I would never revert what you put it, because it happens to be referenced and sourced and what's stated by majority scholarship on this issue.   So it was a valid modification and elaboration etc.  To what I put in, that was also sourced.  As WP policy recommends, \"\"modify instead of wholesale deletion\"\", to improve not remove.   And again, the point of Wilson and Cahill was in the context of the very section and paragraphs themselves, of rationalizing or explaining why Egypt herself never chronicalized things like the  10 plagues or the Hebrew exodus out of Egyptian slavery etc, or the destruction of Egyptian charioteers and soldiers or of that then reigning king of Egypt.   Of course majority historians discount it ever actually happening, but it's also known and admitted (as a general point) that ancient pagan nations or kingdoms in general would not always be so honest or straightforward or complete in their recording of everything.   Embellishing some facts and details, while minimizing or even totally hiding others.   And that was really the point.   Anyway, thanks for your work on it too.

Although I instinctively feel All Blacks should be the name for this page, there is a real difference between the two names - the All Blacks aren't only, as  Cvene64 stated, \"\"the New Zealand Rugby Football Union First XV\"\". The All Blacks were [until very recent tours] also the team which played non-international games on tour. Hence Zinzan Brooke, for example, has played 58 times [58 tests] for 'the New Zealand national team', and another 42 for the All Blacks. A quick look at the official All Blacks site  shows numerous players who have played several matches for the All Blacks but have never played for the New Zealand national team in an international match.\n",

      "Checks and Balances in the Articles for Deletion Nomination Process\n",
      "There needs to be better checks and balances in the process of how articles are currently nominated for deletion, to prevent notable topics from being deleted without actual qualification per Wikipedia article deletion guidelines. This is a significant problem, because it is very likely that notable topics are being injustly deleted. It's easy to nominate an article for deletion and then type five or six words and wait to see if an article will be deleted, whereas it takes more time to refute nominations. Perhaps there should be more sophisticated criterion to nominate articles for deletion. As it is now, anyone can nominate any article without providing a just rationale for doing so, and can instead simply base the nomination upon basic, generic and inspecific statements such as \"\"doesn't pass general notability guidelines\"\", while not specifically stating which parts of the guidelines they are supposedly referring to. If nobody comes along to correct an injust or baseless nomination, the article is then deleted based upon unqualified, general statements that don't actually correspond with the required source searching per WP:BEFORE prior to nominating an article for deletion. This definitely makes it very easy for people to censor Wikipedia, for whatever subjective reasons. Here's how it's done: an article is nominated for deletion and an AfD entry is created, a generic rationale is provided to misqualify the deletion without actually checking for reliable sources to establish topic notability. Afterward, if nobody comes along to correct the faulty nomination, the article is deleted. It's also easy for people to message one-another to delete articles, often per an \"\"as per nom\"\" rationale, while disregarding the actual notability of topics. If nobody comes along and provides an objective analysis to refute the deletion of an article in which the topic is actually notable, nominated per generic statements and without the required source searching prior to nomination, then the article disappears. Hopefully Wikipedia can introduce better checks and balances to prevent this type of easily accomplished, simple censorship. One idea is to include a requirement prior to article nomination for deletion in which the nominator has to state, or check-box on a template, that they've performed the required minimum search in Google Books and in the Google News Archive required by WP:BEFORE, and in Google Scholar for academic subjects, as suggested in WP:BEFORE. This would be a simple addition to the AfD nomination process that would add significant integrity to the process, and would also encourage users to follow the proper procedures.\n",

On Wikipedia, we classify that as original research, which we don't allow. As someone who has in the past taught both high school and college myself, I know that it's actually an odd thing to find out that basically any research paper that a student would write for a typical college level class, as well as a good number of high school papers, would be considered original research under Wikipedia rules. Now, it could be possible to include each of the points individually expressed in the image within the text itself, though we'd have to measure other issues (like how relevant each point is to the larger topic).

      "Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said \"\"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly.\"\" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the \"\"torsion field\"\" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not \"\"just\"\" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that \"\"torsion\"\" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   \"\n",

How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter).

According to linguists like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were societal cleavage based on certain lineages that were slowly cornering certain economic productive mechanisms such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, bards etc. This was in response to a move away from hunter gatherers to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle herding. \n",

      "The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of flux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this milieu the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins  did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus  Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhism were  very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires. \n",

Problem is, people can go here and think the so-much-talked for years now (\"\"sliding towards\"\", \"\"escalating into\"\") civil war is declared and going on, and get confused. This is misleading, to say it mildly. If you are aware of that, this is vandalising. When I first came there, it was even worse - the insurgency (including attacks against Coalition forces) was confused with the sectarian violence (probably copy-pasted without thinking). \n",

      "Oh, and don't talk silly (crazy?) about some \"\"flowers and music\"\". Anyway, I'll answer seriously: the main articles for you are Iraq war, Iraqi insurgency, sectarian violence in Iraq - as the articles' titles alone say, there is \"\"war\"\", \"\"insurgency\"\", and \"\"violence\"\" going on there, each one connected to another (well, Iraqi music is actually too). There are also multiple sub-articles - plenty of these, some with the names like \"\"massacre\"\" (as for your \"\"BLOODBATH\"\"). There even articles on the casualties. Here, you can go back if the \"\"civil war\"\" officially started (that is, declared by the other side-the Shia militias, the government of Iraq, or the UN - the media will start calling it by this name, too).  \"\n",

You can open any map of Russian Empire and you will never see any single mention of the name Tbilisi in any map published in that period.

      "As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: \"\"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and \"\"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group\"\". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression \"\"telephone centrals\"\" instead of \"\"exchanges\"\" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called \"\"Propaganda Wars Returns\"\".  \"\n",

The system is so structured that the only way for black people, is to look to the east and seek repatriation to the continent of their origin guided by the Trinity of Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey and Immanuel and thier teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is the message of Sizzla and it influences his music to the extent that he is being looked upon as the teacher and the inspiration for Jamaican youths who want to retain the basic culture of their African origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sizzla's songs speak to poverty and hopelessness that pervades young Jamaica and obviously oppressed youths worldwide. Like Bob Marley, a couple of generations before him, he delivers a message which speaks to poverty, homelessness, police brutality, cultural pride and political and religious oppression.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Born Miguel Collins,  Sizzla is a product of one of Jamaica's uptown ghettos, August Town.\n",
      "\n",
      "        One of his earliest experiences of how unfair the social system is in Jamaica, was while he was in his mid-teens. In order to get into a Technical High School so he could learn a trade and have a better chance of earning a living, he had to leave High School , go back to pre-high and then apply to get into a High School which taught trades- Dunoon High School, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Dunoon has a reputation of association with some of the best dancehall deejays from the city, including Shabba Ranks and Lady G. So with an inner inclination towards music, it wasn't surprising that while there, he started recording music.\n",
      "\n",

      "        \"\"Fatis\"\" was delighted with his potential, decided to record him.\n",

      "Sizzla, who had originally planned to follow in the footsteps of his mechanic father Aston, suddenly had a change of heart. He abandoned his mechanic training, came under the influence of Buju Banton and Shabba Ranks' cassettes and decided to stick to music.\n",
      "\n",
      "        The auto industry loss was a tremendous gain for the music industry in Jamaica and indeed around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Since the start of 1997, Sizzla's popularity within the music industry has grown so rapidly, he is considered a musical phenomenon. His tunes fill the charts and sales have been so trmrndous that every reggae producer wished he had a Sizzla song to release and every sound system wants a Sizzla dubplate to be current.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Touring with the Xterminator Family and star perfomer Luciano, has gained for him, tremendous experience and exposure and now Sizzla is about to move up the ranks and make his name as a musical prophet and messenger, in his own right\"\n",

It was him that wrote several articles defending the Klan after he supposedly left it.  It was him that as recently as 2001 was throwing around the n-word.  He is the racist, not me.  You have chosen to use your time and effort to defend the racist.  You need to look inside you for your personal motivation on why you feel that you must defend the racist.  The section of the article defending the Kleagle is indefensible.  Look at Trent Lott's bio.  There is no Republican writing an apology for Lott's comments.

I'm very sceptical of such purported discoveries. I mean, 8,000 kilometers (about 5,300 miles) is a lot of mileage for only three and a half years. I can't think of an expedition that would compare (didn't Poyarkov travel a few thousand miles in about the same time period?). Pyanda reminds me of Juan de Fuca: someone who commanded an expedition that supposedly accomplished quite a bit by a person that actually existed, but was recorded years after the fact (Fuca's three decades to Pyanda's century), with little or no primary documents supporting any of the discoveries.

It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.\n",
      "At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is \"\"unyielding\"\" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.\n",

How Kurds feel today might not seem too relevant to his biography, and might be more appropriate in other articles about Turkey. The paragraph should be strictly about what he did or didn't during his political life. Again, I think, we should be extremely careful about striking the right contextual balance.

      "Hello, to whomever may be watching this page. Although I have introduced myself elsewhere on Wikipedia, primarily on the SNCF page, this is my first message here. My name is Jerry Ray, and I am a consultant to SNCF, the French railway company, in Washington, DC. Last year I began reaching out to editors to help address inaccuracies related to the Holocaust in the SNCF article. Now I would like to bring editors' attention to similar issues within this article. \n",
      "\n",
      "As editors here will no doubt agree, this is a difficult subject, but one in which it is highly important to get the facts right. My aim here is to provide a revised version of the current \"\"Modern day legacy\"\" section. This new version, with which I have had some assistance in researching and writing, represents an improvement in several ways. First, it presents a clearer overview of what was at stake in the Liepitz case. Second, it describes the US controversy more accurately, which was not limited to California. Third, it better describes how SNCF handled it and other viewpoints in the case, some of which is retained from the current entry. Lastly, there is a short final paragraph describing actions taken by SNCF in the modern era relating to this episode. \n",

      "In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against French government-owned rail company SNCF by Georges Lipietz, a Holocaust survivor, who was transported by SNCF to the Drancy internment camp in 1944. Lipietz was held at the internment camp for several months before the camp was liberated. After Lipietz's death the lawsuit was pursued by his family and in 2006 an administrative court in Toulouse ruled in favor of the Lipietz family. SNCF was ordered to pay 61,000 Euros in restitution. SNCF appealed the ruling at an administrative appeals court in Bordeaux, where in March 2007 the original ruling was overturned. According to historian Michael Marrus the court in Bordeaux \"\"declared the railway company had acted under the authority of the Vichy government and the German occupation\"\" and as such could not be held independently liable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the Lipietz trial, SNCF's involvement in World War II became the subject of attention in the United States when SNCF explored bids on rail projects in Florida and California, and SNCF's partly-owned subsidiary, Keolis Rail Services America bid on projects in Virginia and Maryland. While bidding on these rail contracts, SNCF was criticized for not formally acknowledging and apologizing for its involvement in World War II. In 2011, SNCF chairman Guillaume Pepy released a formal statement of regrets for the company's actions during World War II.{{cite news |title=SNCF, French Railro\n",

Now because of your this mistake the same Dubious articles will remain on Wikipedia. This is one of the biggest backdrop of wikipedia, admin who dont have expertise in any subject treat all editors as inferior make edits without even looking at its talk page or notices regarding citations . Now other editor will come and claim that prop deletion tag was removed go to Afd and it will go unnoticed their for months and such articles without any citations and some of them are on \"\"Personality who never existed\"\" will continue on Wikipedia. So its my due request that you must give it due attention that such articles are deleted when their time limit of Prop Deletion runs out. Now because you removed the Prop Del tag without any reason other Admin might claim that this is not non-controversial, so you must took notice of this and must act accordingly when their time limit runs out. As admin you are entrusted with responsibility but your recent removal of those tags dont show any maturity. Atleast you should have talked on its \"\"Discussion Page instead of acting like Big daddy , you yourself can see that citation tags are their for many years, so source or citation are not net to back these articles infact i doubt that any such personaility ever existed\"\".

These were 'Saturday sport' which broadcast saturdays 5pm-7pm, 'LIVE MID MORNING SATURDAY/SUNHDAY' (depened which day it was) between 9am and 12 midday.  Finaly he teamed up with nina squires to do the 'Super Sports Saturday Show' between 2pm and 6pm.  He then left ashfield comunity radio in late 2005 to move to 'Regency FM' which broadcast on the internet.  There he ran a show on saturday mornings 10am-1pm 'The Saturday Revolution Show',  Which grew a cult following across north east derbyshire and bangor in Wales.

But Pascal's style of directing appears to be to work with actors and editors in making directing decisions  for instance getting director Anthony Asquith\n",
      "and actor Leslie Howard to direct Pygmalion, and working with editor David Lean and actor/director Harold French to assist on Major Barbara. I don't think this style was a secret. The directing talent behind Pygmalion was decidedly Anthony Asquith, who went on to direct another Shaw play \"\"The Doctor's Dilemma\"\" in 1958, another success, showing it was his magic that turned Shaw's plays into cinema more than Pascal. Pascal's success was to gain the trust of Shaw and get him to grant concetions on the script. It was probably a mistake for him to direct \"\"Caesar and Cleopatra\"\" alone, most likely at Shaw's urging, as he didn't really have the director's skill so much as the art of the deal. But he was so afraid of losing Shaw that he most likely agreed to take total control to please Shaw. Sadly, had he kept Asquith, all his later attempts might have succeeded. Far from the megalomania that he is sometimes portrayed as, Pascal appears to have enjoyed deep collaboration, both with the playright, the directors, and the actors. Shaw came to think of Pascal as such a genius that he probably pushed him too far.  \"\n",

In my opinion, everything after the Trend Micro lawsuit paragraph, up to the backscatter section should be condensed to a single paragraph, or perhaps a list. The inline citations are not really required if the website link at the end leads to the same info. The backscatter sections read more like instructional material, and are not particularly encyclopedic in tone. I do not believe that those sections should be kept in the article.

To be honest, you raise a good point; however, it is my opinion that any children who may see these images of classic paintings will not only be enriched by them, but also they will probably not see the \"\"nasty\"\" side that some adults might see.  When I was a child, I saw great beauty is such works of art.  And I also saw great beauty in a Van Gogh, or a Rembrandt or any number of works by great artists.  Sculptures of David, Venus de Milo and other nude or scantily clad subjects are a part of this world.  And I might add they are some of the better parts of this world. \n",

Are you worried that some child will see these nudes and they will cause him to become a pervert?  Is it your concern that children will be permanently marred by being exposed to nudity?  Children, as you may know, have very short attention spans.  They revel in one fascinating thing after another, rarely staying with one thing for any length of time.  In any case, it is a violation of Wikipedia's Neutral point of view policy, as well as the content preservation policy to remove works of art such as these for no reason other than it is one person's point of view that the nudes should not be viewed by children.  If these images are offensive to you, then by all means use your mouth quickly and click on another article.  There are several other articles related to Truth that can be found in the Navbars near the bottom of the article.  Best of everything to you and yours!\n",

That in Starčević's political career the term \"\"Slavosrb\"\" was used exclusively for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence ? The main \"\"Slavosrbs\"\" were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called \"\"Khuen Serbs\"\"- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the  hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century,  collaborators of Khuen regime ? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally \"\"awoke\"\" as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the \"\"Slavosrbs\"\" tag in Starčević's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Starčević's followers (Stjepan Miletić, August Harambašić, Dušan Kotur, Dušan Vlaisavljević, Milan Ogrizović,..). No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox  Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology. And this must not be forgotten: who had begun with this game of denial ? Who wanted another people's extirpation ?

      "Re. this and this. To put it bluntly, you don't know what you're talking about Murry. First, the IP is not me logging out to edit. HighKing has more than one person who objects to his edits, and rightly so. And second, HighKing was specifically warned by Cailil not to use his own interpretation of sources in making policing edits like this, which is exactly what he did by altering a direct quote that no longer existed on a page to read something else based on what he read in the banner, which has nothing to do with the quote. That is not policy compliant either in letter or spirit. His only policy based options were to remove it, or change the citation to point to where he subsequently found it. He did neither. His alteration of the quote was wrong, and his editting of the page to reflect the current contents of the cite, while not wrong in of itself, falls squarely under Cailil's other warnings. As an aside, in claiming the original author is the person who breached MOSQUOTE, you seem to be assuming that the error in locating the cite for the quote was down to the original author. I see no reason why that should be. It's far more likely that it was moved after the original author used that page as the cite for it. At the end of the day Murry, you're not doing HighKing any favours by defending him in this manner, and in doing so, you might even find yourself under scrutiny from Cailil for engaging in the same behaviour. I suggest you read the entire extended discussion under \"\"Removals of the term British Isles (again) on HighKing's talk page very carefully, lest you find yourself making the same errors in judgement he is making.   \"\n",

      "That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.\n",

I also said that it's debatable if it needs to be there at all, even in the \"\"pared-down\"\" version. I'm reluctant to remove someone's whole contribution, especially when they are a new editor, as I don't want to discourage new editors; but if the consensus feeling is that it should all go, then so be it. Incidentally, regarding \"\"form\"\", when I looked at the mark-up behind the \"\"essay\"\" it showed that the editor had separated it into paragraphs by indenting the separate paras, rather than leaving blank-lines, so it was just a case of a new-editor not being familiar with the correct way to format paragraphs, and ending up with one long para, hence looking like a \"\"rant\"\". Also, new editors tend not to be familiar with the idea of keeping to the salient points and wiki-linking to in-depth articles. talk|contribs \"\n",

If you look at that page it is a very long list of airlines, but if you try to edit it you will see it is actually just a bunch of sublists on separate pages put together. My proposal is to have the main page List of World War I flying aces, and then many subpages List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (A-F) List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (G-Q), List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (R-Z), etc. (I chose those names based on other list series, and so that they will be able to stand as lists on their own.)

His assertion that at no time did MI consider sharing Ultra intel with the Russians has never been contested, not even by MI. His book is notable because it opened the floodgates for other works about Ulta, most notably Bennett's authoritative work with which you're no doubt familiar. Importance of Ultra in Western Allied strategy is either absent from or completely downplayed in wiki milhist articles. When I did submit a reliable Bennett reference (journal article \"\"Ultra and some command decisions\"\") with sourced page numbers etc to one milhist article Western Betrayal some time ago, it was promptly thrown out by consensus as \"\"commie propaganda\"\". That kind of censorship by a reactionary clique has got to change. An uphill task.   \"\n",

      "Mick I think knows this subject more than I do, although I am more or less one of the major (at least frequent, anyway) editors relating to religion and Christianity. Also, in some of his statements, like his accepting the \"\"Apocalypse of John,\"\" is is clear that he definitely qualifies as \"\"former\"\". There are also a variety of Jewish Christian groups, although there is no evidence Dylan belonged to a group that has been described as such. This subject has been extensively discussed before, and in fact led to an editor being banned at one point. He did achieve a great deal of press coverage, and thus notability, for the albums he issued during his \"\"Christian\"\" period, and it is seems on that basis that his \"\"Christianity\"\" be noted. As he has never conclusively subsequently officially renounced any form of Christianity, there is a good chance WP:BLP might enter into our moving him into Category:Former Christians or anything like that, because he has never himself that I know of described himself unequivocally in such terms. In short, this is still a matter of some ambiguity about the subject, particularly taking BLP into account, and I think the current categorization schema was arrived at after those really lengthy, and frankly extremely contentious, discussions. And we really don't have a category of Category:People who have been described as both Jewish and Christian, so this seems to be, basically, the only way to go. Some sort of FAQ template at the top of the page might be useful here, but, in general, I think Mick is among the most productive editors on this article, and I trust his conclusions based on the amount of material he has personally reviewed and his conclusions.   \"\n",

      "I've tried to tone down some statements that seemed to me potentially exaggerated.  For example, the lede described EJ as an adviser to Presidents FDR and LBJ, but the main text did not fully support this statement, relating rather that (a) for a time, his work was read with interest by some in the Roosevelt White House, and (b) he informally advised Johnson while he was in Congress. There were also phrases that seemed a bit loosely applied, and/or POV in nature (e.g., describing FDR's fiscal policy as \"\"hyperactive\"\" I think fails the POV test). \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm further troubled by the statements about EJ's purported anticipation of the rural S&L; crisis, but not sure I quite know enough on the subject to actually make changes (I've instead requested sourcing).  Two points of concern: (a) I'm not sure how relevant it is to predict in the mid-1970s a credit crunch that does not arrive until a decade later (also, to what extent his line of reasoning was accurate  i.e., did the cruch arrive due to factors that he identified, or for quite different reasons?), (b) the article currently relates that the credit crunch \"\"resulted in the savings and loan industry's troubles throughout farm country\"\".  Is this accurate, or would it be closer to the truth to say that it resulted \"\"from\"\" the S&Ls;' troubles?  Not my field of specialization: maybe someone else can take a lok at this passage?   \"\n",

      "Status, let me ask you somethingwhere do you think these budget quotes you put up as gospel come from?  They come from people at these websites evaluating the information available to them.  Nobody ever calls them from the studio and says \"\"Okay, here's what we spent on this movie.\"\"  They do not like that information to be widely available.  In their perfect world, nobody would know what they spent on their moviesthey'd announce a preliminary figure before one frame of film was shot, and no matter how much higher the actual expenses went, that's what people would quote.  But we're curious to know, and it's part of how we decide how well (or poorly) a given film did, so in the very rare event that somebody directly at the center of financing a given film says \"\"Budget was Mid-30's\"\", that's actually a big deal to a site like box office mojo.  They take that very seriously, and they will use that to base a budget estimate onknowing full well that's not the exact figure, and neither they nor any other website will ever have the exact figure.  No movie ever costs exactly 10 million, 20 million, 100 million, etc.  It's always approximate.  It's never exact.  And it's usually lowballed, because studios want people to think they made more money than they really did (or in this case, that they lost less money than they really did).  Now you can see I haven't edited the budget info for this movie in days, so what exactly is your problem here?  You know, if I'd just emailed bomojo on the quiet, it would say 35mil on this article right now.  But I was honest and aboveboard, and this is the thanks I getbeing treated as if I got away with something.  And you're insulting box office mojo into the bargain.  What makes you think they're that easy to fool?  They had access to all the same sources Arre used, and they didn't think they were persuasivethey were persuaded by the article I sent them.  And honestly, I'd rather have that info there than here.  But it should be here as well.  I won't take it on myself to put it upfor now.  But you should think carefully about how this looks.

He now admits he invented the story about Solana being considered the friendliest child in his grade school class.  I was quite surprised to learn this as I honestly thought maybe SqueakBox had information which could be useful to me in the book I am writing about Javier Solana as well as my Wikipedia contributions and blogspot articles.  I asked him for his source and he publicly posted that he got it from the same place as I got that Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana.  The problem with this is that Ariel Sharon really did refuse to meet with Javier Solana and SqueakBox deleted that reference from Wikipedia and defamed me all over the web by falsely claiming I had fabricated that information.  What was fabricated was Squeakbox's claim that the evidence (and website links were posted at the time) did not exist.  J'accuse SqueakBox of intellectual dishonesty to the detriment of Wikipedia and I will be seeking to have him permanently banned from Wikipedia.  Below are just a few of many links proving that contrary to SqueakBox's bold assertions, Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana in July 2004!\n",

Hi Regarding deleting this article as being not notable. the company was founded in 1824 and was an important ant horn comb manufacturer before the advent of plastics  it exported combs from England to America and the company was then very well known an ordinary thing like a comb used to be expensive as it was made of horn. The company Stockley and Wakelin does not trade any more so there is no commercial pourpose. There is another delete tag that that the article violates copyright as the material is elsewhere on the net. There is no copyright violation as the text elsewhere on the internet is my own. I am selling a Comb from made by Stokely and Wakelin on e bay and decided to do a write-up on Stockely and wakely - The comb is being sold for six pounds - so my intention to write the article on the company could hardly be for the purpose of flogging the one ccomb. Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics. Any way the article can be undeleted so that I and other wikipedians may improve on it and contribute to the knowledge of horn combs.\n",

It's a letter the Governing Body received in 1980 from the Watch Tower's chairman's committee, before the Governing Body disfellowshipped many senior Witnesses for \"\"apostasy\"\", and the reason was they were discussing these teachings below. I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine. You would also find it interesting reading Raymond Franz's discussion of each of these points in his two books, Crisis of Conscience and In search of Christian Freedom, and after see if you can still refute them using the Bible as your guide. The letter is below:\n",

      "Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel. These have been brought to the attention of the Governing Body from the field from April 14 onward.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. That Jehovah does not have an organization on earth today and its Governing Body is not being directed by Jehovah.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. There is no proper arrangement as a \"\"faithful and discreet slave\"\" class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people. At Matthew 24:45 Jesus used this expression only as an illustration of faithfulness of individuals. Rules are not needed only follow the Bible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. There are not two classes today, the heavenly class and those of the earthly class also called \"\"other sheep\"\" at John 10:16\n",
      "\n",
      "5. That the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 is symbolic and not to be taken as literal. Those of the \"\"great crowd\"\" mentioned at Revelation 7:9 also serve in heaven as indicated in vs. 15 where it is claimed that such crowd serves \"\"day and night\"\" in his temple (naos) or K. int says: \"\"in the divine habitation of him.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. That we are now living in a special period of \"\"last days\"\" but that the \"\"last days\"\" started 1900 years ago C.E. 33 as indicated by Peter at Acts 2:17 when he quoted from the prophet Joel.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. That 1914 is not an established date. Christ Jesus was not enthroned then but has been ruling in his kingdom since C.E.33. That Christ's presence (parousia) is not yet but when the \"\"sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven\"\" (Matthew 24:30) in the future.\n",

The term \"\"legal adviser\"\" in rule 2 must embrace any lawyer who (a) is chosen by the prisoner, and (b) is entitled to represent the prisoner in criminal proceedings to which the prisoner is a defendant. On the evidence before the court, Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato who falls within the definition of \"\"EEC lawyer\"\" in the 1978 Order. He has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in ongoing criminal proceedings. It therefore follows that Mr Di Stefano falls within the term \"\"his solicitor or counsel\"\" in rule 2 of the Prison Rules.\n",

      "10. The argument which Mr Johnson deployed at the hearing last week was to the following effect: An Italian avvocato is not a solicitor or a barrister; therefore he is not one of those persons entitled under Rule 38 of the Prison Rules 1999 to make a legal visit to Mr Van Hoogstraten in Belmarsh Prison. There was before the court last week evidence that Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato. There are a number of references to this in the documentation before me. Perhaps most pertinently the bundle at page 67 includes Mr Di Stefano's identification card and halfway down we see: \"\"Professione Avvocato\"\". On the right of that there is a photograph of Mr Di Stefano and his signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. There was no reservation by the defendant to the effect that Mr Di Stefano was not an avvocato at all. Argument proceeded last week on the question whether or not an Italian avvocato fell within rule 2(1) and rule 38(1) of the Prison Rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. It should be borne in mind that Mr Di Stefano is the lawyer who has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in criminal proceedings. He has been chosen as the lead lawyer to represent the claimant, and under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the claimant is entitled to be represented by the lawyer of his choice. That must entail the opportunity to confer with the lawyer of his choice before he appears for sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Mr Di Stefano has been appointed as the principal legal adviser of the claimant. It seems to me that Mr Di Stefano has exercised wise judgment in the legal team which he has appointed. He has selected as one of the Leading Counsel to make the plea in mitigation a leading authority in the field of criminal sentencing. Mr Tam submits that with such a distinguished legal team it is quite unnecessary for Mr Di Stefano to visit his client in prison. He can receive instructions at secondhand, and Article 6 does not require Mr Di Stefano's presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. I do not agree. Mr Van Hoogstraten has chosen Mr Di Stefano as his principal legal adviser. The choice of principal legal adviser is for the client. It is not for me; it is not for counsel in this case or anybody else. It is a matter for the client, and if he wishes to appoint an Italian avvocato as his principal legal adviser, and that Italian avvocato has rights to practise in this country under the 1978 Order, then Mr Van Hoogstraten is entitled to take that course. \n",

Now, it appears that the certificates on 64, 65 and 66 are the certificates referred to, but as your Lordship will recall I think a concession was made last week that those certificates are in fact of good character in terms of criminal convictions and charges and do not relate to his status as an avvocato.

Basically I've been doing things here and there, just adding release dates and sources etc as I get a few minutes and come across them. By all means add any relevant, properly sourced material you think it useful (such as release details, directors etc), but it's unlikely it will benefit from going back to being a seperate article. It's definately not a question of favouritism or anything else, it's just a work in progress. Unfortunately Slayers isn't a priority for my editing, so it's very much stop/start at this end. I'm happy to provide example pages if it helps.   \"\n",

      "[ Herb Miller Orch ] \n",
      "né: John Herb Miller (he used the form: J. Herb Miller) \n",
      "b. 1915, d. 1987. Age: 72 (Stroke) \n",
      "Overview \n",
      "Herb Miller, Glenn Miller's younger brother, was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and, like Glenn, studied music in High School. Herb worked his way through college by playing the trumpet. He spent a short spell working in his brother's band, doubling as trumpeter and also as business manager. Herb then accepted an offer to play trumpet with Charlie Spivak. Herb did have a band of his own in the early 1940s. In 1943, he and his band appeared in a movie called \"\"Spotlight Scandals,\"\" starring Harry Langdon (about a year before he died), and featuring singer Bonnie Baker. William Beaudine was the director. Late in the 1950s, Herb formed his band and toured the U.S. with appearances in hotels and ballrooms, including the Aragon Ballroom in Ocean Park, CA, the Jerry Jones Ballroom, and the Rendezvous Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT. Yet, despite Herb's best efforts, the band only met with moderate success. The only album cut by the band, in America, was on Herb's own label, Millertone. While Herb's band never came even remotely close to the fame that his older brother Glenn achieved, it is still active and quite popular in England today (1999). After WWII, Herb settled in Pacific Grove, California, and made that his home base for about 25 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Lovejoy, a former student of Herb's and onetime member of his band, recalls: \n",
      "\"\"Herb didn't form his band while his brother was alive, and not until many years after his brother's death. He was so devastated by his brother's disappearance that he got out of the commercial music business and moved to Pacific Grove, where he got a job as an elementary and junior high school music teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School District. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"I first met Herb when I was in fourth grade and became a beginning trumpet student of his. Herb's son, John, ( -John Arthur Miller, who today still leads the Herb Miller Orchestra in England), was my best friend in grammar school. Herb was a very talented music teacher, gruff but fair, and the kids all loved him. He also was the leader of the Monterey Civic Band, to which most of us Herb Miller Orchestra members belonged. (NB: Mr Lovejoy has advised that circa 2002, the orchestra was re-named the \"\"John Miller Orchestra\"\".) \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Herb, for some reason, decided in the late 1950s to form his own band, and his own children were a part of it. John (known as 'Jackson') played bass and sang; Mary Luann, his eldest daughter, who went by 'Luann', also sang and played piano; Richard 'Richie' Miller, his younger son, played trumpet; and Janet, or 'Jannie,' his youngest child, sang. His wife, Ann, was band manager. Some of the rest of us were his former students who were still in high school or had recently graduated; other members were area teachers. One of his trumpet players, Tony Venza (whose playing sounded like Harry James), drove a moving van for a living. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Initially, Herb was quite ambivalent about using his brother's fame to boost his own image. He actually used to claim that his band and Glenn's were not at all alike. But, in fact, they were almost identical. Herb looked and talked like Glenn ('And now, something a little old, new, borrowed and blue...'), although he was shorter in stature. He played Glenn's most famous songs, and his own arrangements sounded just like Glenn's. The only difference was that he used only two trombones instead of four, as Glenn did. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The first record Herb made was called 'First Steps Of A New Miller' on the Millertone label. It was a failure, of course, since he paid for it out of his own pocket, and distribution was limited. And, of course, even in the 1950s-'60s, his music was dated. He thought it was because of rock and roll, which he fervently believed was a communist plot. He reasoned that the communists introduced rock and roll into American culture in order to put 'legitimate' musicians out of work and thereby ruin the American economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Herb had a few other idiosyncrasies, too. For instance, when people found out he was Glenn's brother, they would inevitably mention Glenn's death. Herb would explode, 'Glenn's not dead! Don't ever say that again!' Later, a few years after he'd started his own band, he seemed to have accepted his brother's death. That's when he started drinking and when he started trading on his brother's name. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"After moving to England, he really went overboard on comparing himself to Glenn. He even had a poster made up with him posing exactly like the famous picture of Glenn, holding a trombone and looking over his shoulder. This was kind of strange because Herb's main instrument was the trumpet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Herb was one of the most intense and driven people I've ever known. And, he was\n",

What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article. \n",

Of interest, I actually think I saw PC2 used in a protection situation just last month (February) by an administrator.  So apparently it's still being used by administrators at this very moment.  Now personally, I have no control to the point I can remove PC from articles (or readd it), so in that extent my opinion is just that: an opinion.  Nothing more.  If administrators are instructed to remove it, they remove it and stop using it.  I can't go looking through the articles and remove it (if I can, I have no idea how).  I still think there is no issue with leaving it until a further decision is made; it's the same argument I made for Nail Yakupov before it was userfied to my space, even though he is a lock for Rookie of the Year and others said let's delay this AfD because this will make him truly notable, the closing admin. decided to userfy NEway, only to make me move it back in two weeks once they announce the award.

No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.

From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.\"\"\n",

For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History.

Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.

      "\n",
      "A few English universities now offer the degree of \"\"Doctor of Engineering\"\" (EngD), which, like the PhD, is also a research-based degree, but differs from the traditional UK PhD in several important ways. Specifically,\n",
      "\n",
      "1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng \"\"programs\"\"), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng \"\"fulfill\"\") the requirements for the degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a \"\"professional degree\"\", even though it remains a research degree as emphasized above\n",

Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner, or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.

      "No Lists of top ten venomous snakes don't belong in ANY encyclopedia, including Wikipedia. These kinds of lists belong maybe in a children's book. Venom composition is not static. Even within a single individual, it will vary in quantity and relative proportions of components over time. Greater variability in components is seen between individuals of a species, greater still between species. Further, venom continues to evolve, often very rapidly, so there may be wide variations in venom composition and toxicity within a single species, over its geographic range. This is especially true for widely distributed species and may cause problems in antivenom effectiveness. Factors involved in the variation of venom and its toxicity include diet/habit variability, seasonal changes, geographical location, age-dependent variability, gender-dependent/sexual variability, altitude, and the list goes on. Then you've got the research methods used. This can be critical, as some snakes produce many venom components, but eject them sequentially, rather than as a uniform mixture. The immediate fate of the venom after collection is important, particularly in relation to environmental conditions that might denature certain components. The storage of the venom is also vital, and exposure to heat may cause damage to certain toxins. Prolonged storage in liquid form may damage others. Pooled venom may introduce many variabilities, because each pooled batch of venom will contain venom from different specimens, compounding both intra-individual and intra-specific variability. There are many potential variables in such research that may affect comparability and interpretation of results. The choice of test animal may be crucial, because each species may respond differently (including humans). The choice of route is also critical. The standard test of toxicity is the LD50. Mice are most commonly used. The LD50 remains the most universal standard for determining and comparing toxicity of venoms. As an example, the rough scaled snake (Tropidechis carinatus) has a much less potent venom than the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), on LD50 testing in mice. Yet clinically, the two venoms are virtually identical in the type and severity of effects on envenomed humans. There are many examples just like this across all species. The black mamba is not the most venomous snake species in the world, but it untreated human moratality rates are 100% and produces death in the most rapid time. To compare, the many-banded krait has a more potent venom on mice, but doesn't produce the same devastating effects on humans the way the black mamba does. Many more examples are readily available. Mice aren't humans. Yes, they may give us an idea on toxicity, but they aren't the same as humans. Talk to me! \"\n",

The length alone is sign of denialist bias, but including unsubstantiated accusations (no methodology in Kanin's study) just because it can be quoted to David Lisak is probably abusive and misleading.

The thing with Martha and Jonathan is that they aren't going to get any bigger. We still have season 9 ahead of his, and potentially season 10, which means potentially more appearances from these members as well as new ones. The only problem I forsee is that they have not greenlit a season 8 companion yet, because sales on season 7 weren't that great. But, as far as these specific characters go I should be just fine. I have a whole section in season 6 companion on their costumes (which I can probably scan that image and overlay it with their traditional comic book representations for a new gallery image).

My concern in this article is to clarify the Nationality section in the InfoBox of Nonito Donaire page or what country did he really represents. Donaire is a Filipino-American. Why? Because he was born in Talibon, Bohol Province of the PHILIPPINES. He is a natural-born Filipino citizen (by birth and by origin - his Father is a Filipino and a member of the Philippine Army). He is only a dual-citizen of the USA. Therefore, his PRIMARY Nationality is FILIPINO. In BoxRec.com, he was registered as a FILIPINO boxer and the country that he represents is the PHILIPPINES. He was aliased as The FILIPINO Flash, he sings the PHILIPPINE National Anthem before his fight and he and his team carries the PHILIPPINE Flag. In the RingTV, it only shows the residency of a boxer where Donaire is residing at San Leandro, California, USA. Like the Puerto Rican boxer Kermit Cintron, it only shows in the RingTV that he resides at Texas, USA but he is a Puerto Rican by Nationality.

Not adhering to Wiki policy, constantly breaching anti-reversion rules and generally trolling to try and start editing wars with new editors. His latest revert - after admin decision - is clearly spiteful vandalism.\n",
      "1) he left the article in an unreferenced state for months, and made no attempt to clear them up or remove them.\n",
      "2) he took exception to an entry that was referenced properly, including a reference to the BBC - the BBC being a reference source for other items on this page, yet hypocrisy reared its head and TheOldJacobite failed to acknowledge, only finally accepting when having the nonsense of his illogical inconsistent application of policy pointed out.\n",
      "2a) he also claimed that the newspaper source included wants notable enough despite having a readership level that warranted its own actual entry in Wikipedia - a newspaper that has been published for over 100 years.\n",
      "3) he continually reverts the repair of the included entry, which meets ALL Wiki policies. These are reverted accordingly by me as they breach no rules but simply have some personal issue with TheOldJacobite. Maybe TheOldJacobite thinks he owns the page. Who knows what motive lies behind the behaviour?\n",
      "4) He then summons up 'help' from a sock-buddy who also removes it and then threatens me with blocking because he can't gets his own way. That editor has no and rights so simply reverts to threats and bravado against a new user. it should be noted that Sjo has been previously warned on his page about treating new editors with contempt and warning him to stop simply removing new edits, so a behaviour pattern that is common to both of them.\n",
      "5) TheOldJacobite then has me referred to admin for alleged vandalism - no action is taken. TheOldJacobite also tries to make me out as some sort of vandal purely because I have an IP rather than a full username...this is just childish diversion tactics,\n",
      "6) TheOldJacobite requests the page is locked - no action is taken as admins clearly don't agree. If anything it should be locked against him reverting a totally acceptable entry.\n",
      "7) Electric Wombat (admin) reviews the entry and determines it's good for inclusion and asks all to stop the edit war. I agree but would like to see an equal admonishment made to TheOldJacobite and Sjo for their arbitrary editing, non equitable application of policy and the gang-up bullying mentality against a new user. But, I won't hold my breath as I've seen all of TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's disciplinary record and it's clear that nothing really gets done about trolls like these so-called [editors] who simply delight on playing judge and jury and clearly think they own Wikipedia.\n",
      "8) Despite Electric Wombat's decision of inclusion, TheOldJacobite again reverts the entry.  this is clearly against strict Wiki rules about reverting after an admin decision has been made. I wonder if ThOldJacobite will be blocked temporarily for sticking two fingers up at the admin team?\n",
      "9) I have now applied the admin decision and reverted it back to what it was before TheOldJacobite vandalised it yet again.\n",
      "10) I am wondering if Wikipedia is broken beyond repair when it allows personal and prejudicial views of editors like TheOldJacobite and Sjo to interfere with the mission statement of Wikipedia to create a globally-contributed knowledge base.\n",

      "Support - This has developed into more than an uprising, how much blood has to spill before the folks who oppose the name change can call this a war? Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone. After months of violence that ranged from smaller domestic disurbances to riots with people being killed, the United States decides to close their embassy and get all of their diplomats out of the country. Why now and not earlier? This is another sign that things are getting worse. I believe the United States has enough intelligence in the country to know what's going, war has started and it was time for the U.S. to get any Americans in the country out of harms way.\n",
