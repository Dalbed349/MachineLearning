Having spend considerable times in the field where it occurs, I have yet to hear anyone referring to it as a conure in these regions. This term is, as far as I know, strictly used in aviculture. I have seen the argument used that it, as well as other members of the genus Pyrrhura, are conures, but not parakeets (and it would therefore be wrong to call them parakeets), but this is wrong, as both groups as typically defined (see conure and parakeet) are polyphyletic.\n",

He was already teaching long before Yogananda was even born, in fact even before Lahiri Mahasaya started his ministry. There are accounts of Panchanon Bhattacarya as well as Tincouri and Ducouri Lahiri handing prayaschitta money directly to Babaji, and also a personal visit of Babaji to the house of Lahiri Mahasaya witnessed by Pranavananda. So it is somewhat safe to conclude that Mahavatar Babaji was a \"\"normal\"\" human being intermingling with people in civilization, though probably exaggerated thru time. So, what we need here is a book published before Autobiography of a Yogi saying that the Baba of Hariakhan is Lahiri Mahasaya's guru? What if I can provide that?

      "Le Grand, you are not innnocent. So why do you continue to act like the victim here? You twisted many of the things around on me. I talked with Ran on his talk page about you, that's the only case you are right about. The other cases you assume (collectarian and Judgesurreal's talk pages): I didn't mention your name once. Instantly assuming things isn't helping matters. It's clear you haven't avoided me either, the list of Ring of Honor events AFD (which I believe you explained with: \"\"I'm part of the wrestling project\"\") is one example. Project members aren't required to visit/post in AFDs of the project's scope. You could've had restraint there, but didn't. The fact you come here to harass me during a block, is also bad faith in my view. In response to McJeff's RFC link he provided, see this section: /Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/RobJ1981#Findings. It was found that McJeff was a part of the problem. Remember: it takes two to have a conflict, and the evidence I provided at the RFC shows McJeff isn't innocent either. If he ignored more things, it would be a different story. But for the most part: McJeff harassed me, and egged me on to get a reaction out of me. Also, Le Grand's repost of ANI comments here isn't productive in my view. People can see the ANI post clearly, so there's no need to be redundant.   \"\n",

What Updegrove, Califano and other historians take issue with is how Johnson, who spearheaded the drive to pass the Civil Rights legislation and who proactively engaged and supported King, is portrayed as either a reluctant or obstructionist actor or self-interested opportunist.

While it will be done before the end of 2014, it still takes place within the 2014/15 football season (as shown on the info box below), and when the next season edition (and so on) takes place with a January final, will create an odd situation where there is a 2014 FFA Cup article, then 2015/16, and ongoing 20xx/xx article titles. It is better to standardise them now to a full seasonal date. There is also the possibility that a shift in competition dates over multiple seasons could see a competition run entirely in the first half of the year, followed by another edition of the tournament that starts and finishes in the second half of the year, which would lead to a very odd title situation if we go by a 'calendar year' article title process, eg we could end up with a hypothetical situation of having to disambiguate two editions of the tournament played in the same calendar year despite being in different football seasons.   09:14, 15 May\n",

Linguists are said to be concerned \"\"normally\"\" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter. The notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate, when seeking such help, and when making such decisions ourselves, is not only perverse and deplorable, but also patently wrong. We begin our lives incapable of speech. Is it wrong to acquire the ability? Is it right to call instruction in the application of the rules of grammar an invalid activity? Banning prescriptive grammar from the general article on grammar and suggesting that it is illegitimate are serious mistakes, motivated, I suspect, by timidity, laziness, irresponsibility, and ignorance. Only a stubborn, intentional, dedicated ignorance can maintain that proficiency in English composition must not be taught, nor properly called \"\"grammar\"\".  \"\n",

Perhaps you could provide some form of arbitration. There is no particular dispute at this moment although over the past few months, user Gibnews has imposed his POV version of the article on the vast majority of users. Other opinions backed with acceptable sources are dismissed by him as pro-Spanish. He also seems to convey a sense of irrational hostility towards Spain and Spaniards which are reflected in his edits. If you check the history of the talk page, he has driven away a number of users over the past few months. He is now engaged in disputes regarding articles on \"\"San Roque\"\" and \"\"Algeciras\"\" (cities close to the British territory of Gibraltar.) Permanently banned user \"\"Gibraltarian\"\" has recently returned to support him as an unregistered user signing as \"\"yanito\"\".

The basic geometry of the double cardan is identical with or without the centering element, and is identical whether the intermediate coupling is a short shaft, long shaft or yolk (as in the case of the joint) - the references provide sufficient information to make this clear - no more references are required - the whole point of a centering element with a DC joint is to fix the differential angle problem.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I gather you've have been assuming all along that the double cardan must include a centering element (while I have assumed the more general case), and this is why you've been challenging the validity of some aspects of the article?What is your view of my previous post or are we close to reaching an agreement?  \"\n",

      "First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your \"\"sky is blue\"\" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that \"\"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris\"\". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that \"\"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower\"\" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   \"\n",

It does not mean a victory of tactical formation, but rather a \"\"success in battle without substantive or long-lasting gain\"\", as opposed to a [[strategic victory which is \"\"a success in a military campaign\"\". If one sets ones sights low enough, and claim the goal of the operation was merely to establish a bridgehead, then it was a clear Soviet victory. However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do. While the overall campaign was a clear strategic victory for the Soviets because they won the campaign in the end, it was a tactical victory for the Germans because they were successful in holding Narva even though it was not long lasting, i.e. six months.   \"\n",

Speaking of which, if one wanted to adapt WP:Germany's version of the table depicting importance scale, where would one paste it at WP:CRO project's page?

In your initial message to me, given at the time when you reverted all of the work I had done, you called my efforts vandalism and nonsense; I realize this is probably a auto-generated message sent in response to a flagged *accidental* event, but given that I've made several attempts to communicate to you, via this page as well as four or five times thru the original \"\"vandalism/nonsense\"\" (to which to you responded *once*, with, I might add, a tone that was less than in keeping with the tone I see when I read the messages on this page).  Nevertheless, what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it  I had added the the Moline page a \"\"location\"\", \"\"air travel\"\", \"\"major interstate highways\"\", \"\"sports\"\", \"\"gambling\"\", and \"\"landmarks; and notable bridges\"\" sections.  Additionally, I completely revamped the schools section into an \"\"education\"\" section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned.  You removed all of that.  BTW, I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page, so anyone could see what I was trying to do: make the Moline page better.  Before I found it, it was little more than a glorified rundown of which neighborhood has more Mexicans than the next... and I found it simply too racist to let stand.  Yes, I also was trying to edit the Neighborhood section, to remove the racism, but also better demonstrate the real flavor and history of the town.  Thanks to you, the history and flavor is gone, and the racism is back...  Congratulations.  A final request; if you see fit to keep my efforts out of the wiki, then please be so kind as to be consistent, for I still see the results of my writing on the Moline page.  IF you are going to remove my work and have the Moline page reflect the rants of one racist hick, please be consistent and completely remove all of my work - either keep all of my work in... or none of it.

In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.\n",

And I understand your view of the criteria but I don't think it's correct because, and that is what I said to Keegan on your RFA as well, admins do not decide whether something is worthy of inclusion. A7 for example is just about whether it may possibly be worthy of inclusion, not if they are worthy. When you gain adminship, you have to remember that your personal views of what is worthy of inclusion and what not are completely irrelevant to your work handling pages where there is doubt (there is an ArbCom case at the moment because one admin decided to delete pages he deemed unencyclopedic outside policy).

I have argued, but to no avail, that when a free image turns up (there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now), that event renders my present copyright statement invalid, at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image.

I don't want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i've been working on recently are good or bad.  These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.  Anyhow, hope you are doing well in your other activities.  Thanks,\n",

They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area.

      "THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? \n",

It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets. Closer examination will further show that even some of the blog sourced material happens to be previously published np photos and/or articles that were scanned and posted in the blogs.\n",

      "Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology. I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance.

I know some other people seem equally absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that the correct pronunciation is /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (\"\"en-VID-ee-uh\"\"), and the only explanation I can come up with for this discrepancy is that those people's speech may have the \"\"pin-pen merger\"\" (please go read that if you aren't familiar with the term) — whereas my own speech does not have the pin-pen merger, and I therefore \"\"hear\"\" the pronunciation differently from some other people.  Or, perhaps the person whose voice was recorded for the NVIDIA animated logo happens to speak a regional dialect with the pin-pen merger, and none of the NVIDIA execs have noticed or cared.\n",

You must read the article again, especially the intro. \"\"Defrauding people of money is presumably the most common type of fraud, but there have also been many fraudulent \"\"discoveries\"\" in art, archaeology, and science.\"\"  The latter two fields are distinctly separate even thought archeoology is a kind of social science, scholarly, it belongs to anthropology and history. Fujimura is an archaeologist, so that his case has been a good example of the archaeological fraud. Therefore, you should've provided a good rationale for your removal of the perfect example from the article. Rather, you insist on replacing it with Korean example in order to retaliate against my revert. You also placed the new addition at the top of the section, and the placement is very odd because if you really want to compromise with me, you should've made a group to Fujimura, the other archaeological case and the science case. You think Hwang Woo-seok case is more notable and I think Fujimura is more notable, so we disagree on the point.

      "\"::I would say that the process of \"\"lumping\"\" and \"\"splitting\"\" is intimately connected to phylogenetics (not to cladistics) by the fact that reality is ambiguous, both in a momentary and in a historical perspective. This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]\n",

The Phalanx image was a casualty as it really offered nothing new: that's just a pose shot of Ultron, and not too dissimilar to the main image in the SHB. The imasge to add if anything is the shot from the Iron Man cover, which I will try to find as it shows yet another different version of Ultron. The Phalanx info was trimmed to what is necessary. There's no need for unnecessary plot extrapolation (clumsy, usually with POV and also a spoiler) when the gist, offering a teaser, is sufficient.

If Abtract and Sesshomaru want to work informally to Abtracts formula (and Collectonian notes Abtracts areas of interests), then it simply means they don't report each other.

      "Since I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking \"\"buh-bye\"\" commentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eric Hoffer wrote, \"\"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.\"\"  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a \"\"non-notable\"\" and a \"\"vanity\"\" article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.\n",

I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. \n",

Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.\n",

Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define \"\"circumcision\"\" would ask the question, \"\"which type? Male or female?\"\" In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.

If Efghi is correct and only Costa Rica, El Salvador, United States accept Jerusalem as Israel's capital, that means in or around 150 don't, in which case we cannot possibly put down Jerusalem on its own as the capital.

      "\"Much of the history article is taken directly from Hillsdale's website, and I would agree that much of it reads like an advertisement, but, in all fairness, there really hasn't been enough published on Hillsdale apart from the college itself.  I have tried doing EBSCO host searches and have looked for titles in my university library (the largest library in my state, mind you), and I have been unable to find a single title that is exclusively about Hillsdale College.  I suspect the reason is that, while it was once a radical college, it has become more conservative as the world has changed.  It was expected to become more radical, in the way that Antioch College did; but it didn't.  I think that the best solution is for outsiders to acknowledge Hillsdale's impressive history while still writing about it from an objective point-of-view.  If there are other people willing to write about the school, there will be less need to visit the \"\"Imprimis\"\" website to compose a wikipedia article on the subject.\n",

      "For Kendall Whitehouse, senior director of information technology at Wharton, the most interesting question is \"\"whether the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately a better approach compared to scholarly review and edited content.\"\" As Whitehouse observes, \"\"Wikipedia's strength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it. The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected.\"\".. Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is. So you might as well design a system around that concept, go with the natural design of the system, work with it to all its advantages, not work against it and try to limit it with \"\"old media\"\" concepts.  \n",

It's absolutely ridiculous what I-P is turning into on Wikipedia and it is largely a result of this interaction ban which is broken on a nearly daily basis. It is pitting the two \"\"sides\"\" against each other and it has gotten worse than I have ever seen it. The interaction ban is not working; therefore, I hope that you will do something else that can help this situation before it completely falls apart. Here are the newest violations of the interaction ban:\n",
      "I know you are already aware of the post that was made at AN/I. It had a direct mention of Mbz1 by Factomancer through diffs. It was not a complaint about an interaction ban violation on Mbz1's part, so there was no reason for Factomancer to be mentioning Mbz1. You responded at that AN/I and didn't do anything about it, so I guess you didn't consider it a violation for some reason. Maybe because she attempted to strike out and delete the request after the fact? Although personally that makes it worse in my eyes, but clearly I'm not the admin. \n",
      "Anyway, past AN/I, she put the same violation on her user page here . It is also a clear violation of WP:UP#POLEMIC. Soon after, she also removed this information, replacing the content with this  stating that she is going on a long break. She has done this before when she has gotten herself into big trouble, only to change her mind after a couple of days and come back. As we can see, her temporary break in that case didn't change her behaviour, as here we are once again.\n",
      "I'm truly tired of dealing with this crap. Last year we actually had some sort of collaboration going on in I-P on Wikipedia, before we had to deal with issues like this (to this severity, at least). A combination of a few \"\"new\"\" users coming into the I-P struggle relatively recently have turned it into a real warzone between the two sides, and I don't like it. I don't think other people like it either. It is having an EXTREMELY detrimental effect on the encyclopedia in the I-P area, because not only is so much of our time wasted fighting and defending each other in constant AE and AN/I reports, or sitting out short bans for minor infractions, but even aside from that, it just isn't rewarding or feasible to try to contribute and collaborate anymore. There is no longer an expectation that posting something constructive on a talk page will lead to discussion from people who disagree. There is no point of making significant edits to articles because they are simply followed up by quick reverts, often with no edit summary.\n",
      "I was planning on coming up with some conclusion to this complaint to convince you to take action, but you know what, typically as of late I've even lost my motivation to do that. I just don't care; it's a waste of time and probably won't get the atmosphere between editors back to what it used to be anyway. The problem is that all you can do (or are willing to do anyway) is impose bans based strictly upon the word of the rules interpreted specifically based on the individual situation. If you took a minute to look at the big picture and understand the impact that certain users are having on the entire I-P editing community with their constant infractions and battles, maybe you would think of a different solution.   \"\n",

I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about \"\"popular parlance\"\", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the \"\"popular parlance\"\" of much of the world, \"\"Great Britain\"\" and \"\"England\"\" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have an issue with the statment \"\"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition\"\" as found in the first paragraph. I changed \"\"deeply\"\" to \"\"deceptively,\"\" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I may not have convinced you, personally, that Beckett’s work is more optimistic than pessimistic. But perhaps I’ve made a case that a flatly factual statement like “Beckett's work is stark . . . and deeply pessimistic about the human condition” is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you. He once said that if he were a pessimist, he wouldn’t write.  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work, that ought to count for something.\"\n",

      "Due to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:\n",
      "Over 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.\n",
      "Almost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.\n",
      "The only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.\n",
      "There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)\n",
      "Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n",

Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the \"\"www.\"\" subdomain, it redirects to it with the \"\"www.\"\" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had \"\"www.\"\" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to \"\"www.Evanescence.com\"\".

Centred in the southern part of the region, (i.e. present-day Northern Greece) this kingdom seems to have been largely Greek-speaking, with Thracian and Illyrian admixtures. By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized. Macedonia’s Greek ethnic composition was overturned by the invasion of Slavic peoples into the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.\n",

The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Under the Romans, Paeonia was included in the second and third districts of the province of Macedonia.

The band takes huge influence from both new wave AND gothic rock, as well as other genres, but darkwave usually takes influence from other genres - so does Gothic rock. There's a huge difference.

      "Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a \"\"revolutionary design\"\" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial \"\"flat turret\"\" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped \"\"hexagonal turret\"\" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.  \n",

      "DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text \"\"awful\"\", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:\n",

      "1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie \"\"Alexander Nevsky\"\", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.\n",

      "2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.    \n",

If there was a massive wave of newcomers there should be genetic evidence.

Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.\n",

Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.\n",

That's one more proof you don't read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don't check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I'm not convinced you can give any actual evidence there's an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn't even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my \"\"little rant\"\" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my \"\"various pronouncements\"\" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn't it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here.

Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was \"\"made up in school in one day\"\" by reading \"\"my webpage\"\".

This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it.

Even apart from the fact that you are generalising on several items: mode, temperature, duration of exposure, plus even more pertinent: on source of oil (what plant it is coming from, and which part of it) and whether it is a methyl ester or ethyl ester. In my view it is irresponsible to say categorically that biodiesel is non-toxic.

I agree to it. Then Ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. Blueboy, a new admin that improperly blocked me, an established editor, as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom I blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. He is supported by, guess who, Jehochman, Durova, and Athaenara, whom I also have history with and whose WP:RFA I made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. I can provide diffs for all of this but I want to show you one thread now, over at Wikinews.

      " My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter . It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use \"\"facts\"\" based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT \"\"fact\"\" often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video. Perhaps you can find a peer-reviewed article that gives an explanation how PRT can \"\"pay for itself\"\". I have been unable to find any authoritative explanation how PRT can operate without public subsidies. Thank you.   \"\n",

      "I pretty much agree with all that, but it seems incomplete.  There are other important policies and guidelines.  For example, there's WP:Consensus, and WP:Summary style, and WP:Undue weight to name a few.  Just because some inserted material satisfies WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:NOR does not mean that an editor can insist (repeatedly) on inserting it into an article.  And whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ferrylodge, I certainly accept that other policies may apply.  And I know you are acting in good faith with good intentions.  But with all due respect, I think your message muddies the waters.  First of all, \"\"undue weight\"\" is a subsection of NPOV.  By my linking NPOV, I simultaneously included undue weight.  The difference is, I made it clear that NPOV is the umbrella policy and \"\"undue weight\"\" is just a component of that policy and has to be interpreted in the context of the policy as a whole.  You took it out of context which could mislead some people.  Also, \"\"Summary style\"\" is not a policy.  I was talking primarily about policies.  Summary style is a guideline and it may be useful to editors but it does not have the force of a policy.  Finally, I agree with you about consensus, but the consensus policy addresses a different issue than I was raising.  My point was about what can go into articles.  Consensus says nothing about what can or cannot go into articles.  The consensus policy is about interpersonal behavior and process.  The consensus policy is not about content; NPOV, V, and NOR are about content.  It is NPOV, V, and NOR that determine what is acceptable and unacceptable content.  The consensus policy lays out a process for resolving conflicts over content.  But it does not establish principles for resolving the conflict.  The principles remain NPOV, V and NOR.  When editors get into a conflict, we should consult WP:CONSENSUS for ideas about how we can better work together.  But before consensus-based editing, the first step to working together is agreeing to abide by the content policies, NPOV, NOR, and V.    |  Talk \n",

Such a blatant bit of copyright violation see WP:COPYVIO and conflict of interest justifies its removal straight away which I will do shortly. Frankly, it would have been a bit more transparent if you had said it was you who had lifted it! Turning to the Sainsbury's article and reference to Jamie Oliver I have remedied this by adding an article from The Grocer which addresses the need for a citation.

His book A Nation on Trial was named a notable book for 1998 by the New York Times.

It does mean that the brackets aren't in the same font style as the message, though (e.g. Boden Professor of Sanskrit election, 1860, which is still accepting comments at peer review by the way... ). If you or any of my fellow TPSers has a better idea, I'm all for it.  Regards, Talk \"\n",

In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.

Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been \"\"studying\"\" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi \"\"The Rav of Sakmer\"\". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער.

      "I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. \n",

The same could go for \"\"300 up to 5,000 people, mostly of Hispanic descent, had been killed by Rangers\"\" and \"\"Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves became numerous\"\" (sourced again).

The statement that read \"\"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a \"\"waste and fraud,\"\" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of \"\"AmeriCorps NCCC\"\" nor of the \"\"National Civilian Community Corps\"\" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.\"\"  We regret the error.\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book \"\"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither \"\"AmeriCorps NCCC\"\" nor the \"\"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as \"\"AmeriCorps NCCC'\"\" or the \"\"National Civilian Community Corps\"\".\n",

      "3.  Also untrue was the sentence \"\"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] \"\"a fraud\"\".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.\n",

No mention of either the \"\"National Civilian Community Corps\"\" nor of \"\"AmeriCorps NCCC\"\" appears in that article.

Ajax is consistently referred to as the second greatest warrior at Troy, in the Iliad, but this is made somewhat confusing in Book 23.

      "I have been wikistalked by an administrator Hu12 and his coconspirator, Barek.  The dispute arose because I had put in a link to a Central Michigan University timeline on lighthouses in Michigan in an article on Marquette, Michigan  the link was perfectly appropriate, and was not a commercial site or spam.  I received a note from Barek saying he had deleted the link on the Discussion page.  I told him it was a perfectly fine link and that his action was ill-advised.  The next thing I knew, Hu12 intervened.  The two of them started Wikistalking me together, removing not just the link, but removing the link from every page where I had put it.  Additionally, they started doing blind \"\"Undos\"\" and obliterating large portions of articles that I had contributed.  There was no reason for any of this.  When I protested their course of action, they suspended my editing privileges.  This was done precipitously.  BK Conrad has investigated this matter, and deems the blind edits to be 'unfortunate.'\n",

      "Baroque Guitars are NOT \"\"ten-string guitars\"\"\n",
      "Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a \"\"ten-string guitar\"\". No one refers to the baroque lute as \"\"the 24-string lute\"\", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. \"\"12-string guitar\"\" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular \"\"cult(ure)\"\" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term \"\"ten-string\"\" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.\"\n",

And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.

You should not be offended really IMHO because the point of coming to a noticeboard is to get opinions from independent editors. As on the face of it you all have something very much in common you should be happy to drop out of the argument and let other editors who do not have a proclivity to editing articles on extremist politics to make their comments known.

Stormie’s behavior is similar to that of neo-Nazis who cover up for the National Socialist German Workers’ Party. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html Stormie's name (and Stormie’s behavior) probably makes people think of “stormtrooper.” But that point would never cross the mind of Stormie's dim-witted cohorts. In similar stormtrooper imitation, wikilings ban people who post accurate information exposing neo-nazi activity.  They delete anything, including even links, to accurate information. They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults.

Even among Christian \"\"believers\"\", the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the \"\"other\"\". Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all \"\"conservative\"\" churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005\n",

I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede. I should also note that many of our sources are for-profit media outlets who have no qualms about distorting stories to make them fit their most profitable narrative agenda, which, in this era, is black/white racial conflict (the coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting is an excellent example).

In retrospect that was unjustified, no matter how I was being treated, but at the same time it is unfair to ignore that my comments were not unprovoked.  10:03, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)\n",

      "I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists. Thank you, be well, and please accept my questions with all seriousness.\n",

I hope you would agree that they're nicely merged and don't take from the quality of the article. As for the reliable sources, I think I made my points about 1. Drowned in Sound being cited by Reuters. 2. Gigwise being cited by Absolute Radio and Prefix Magazine. 3. Both Click Music and Subba-Cultcha having fact-checking and editorial review. Plus the material in both cases is an exclusive interview rather than original research. Finally, considering that the band are fairly new they would not have had the chance to talk in major publications. Does that answer your points or did you have something else to point out?

In the back-mirror, I was a little too hasty to re-instate and should of course instead first have uploaded the content to my sandbox, and then asked for the talkpage approval before uploading it again. Please however consider, that all my actions were only excecuted in good faith. Subsequently I was surprised to find a continued resistance about the content from fellow editors here at the talkpage. Based on those grounds, I of course accept your removal of the content from the article, and have just created a  for the subsequent debate we shall now still continue to have, about the appropriateness (which I still claim) to include a monthly data table in the article.\n",

      "In regards of your claim that my most recent version of the uploaded disputed material is still WP:OR, I will request you to return with a reply why you think this is so, and what we in your opinion need to do in order for the content to satisfy the policy. As far as I know, we are allowed at Wikipedia to create our own wikitables to display fully referenced data, which it indeed was in my latest version of the data table. I admit at first to have uploaded unsourced \"\"Monthly reference value data\"\" that strived against WP:OR, which was something I only did as part of a process, in the hope for other editors (or myself) at a later stage being able to find direct sources for those values. Yesterday, I indeed managed to find a direct source for these monthly values published by the Polish Ministry of Finance. Please take into consideration, that we do not have 2 equal WP:PS for the same data but only have 1 (The Polish source), as I have managed to proof here at the talkpage that the Latvian source do not qualify for the purpose, as it did not strictly follow the published official \"\"ECB evaluation method\"\" (which it by the way funny enough also never claimed it did) - but instead has adopted its own data approach. Please also consider, that my uploaded data table with monthly data in principle can stand alone, even without that we mention the debated report by the \"\"Latvian Central Bank\"\", as I have prooved here at the talkpage they utilised another data approach than the official \"\"ECB method\"\". After I now have ellaborated on the details, do you then have a different opinion whether or not my most recent version of the uploaded material still shall be classified as WP:OR?\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why I think it is so important that we in the Latvian article display monthly convergence values for each month for the past year, and why inclusion of this material shall not be disquallified as per WP:NOTSTATS, is because the uploaded monthly data (for the most recent 12 months) reflect how the official \"\"ECB method\"\" works, as a graphical illustration which help casual readers to grasp that all candidate countrys have been granted the right by EU to apply ECB for conducting a monthly convergence check at each month during the year (if they belief to have met all criteria). Unfortunately ECB do not automatically publish monthly convergency reports during the year (because in that case we would obviously have used their direct data for the table instead). But as I already provided evidense for, the Polish Ministry are publishing monthly reports where they check for monthly convergence and calculate the ECB reference value limits based on the official \"\"ECB method\"\" (which proofs this is notable stuff), and their findings in the Polish context has also been covered over at the Polish wikipedia (although by a much lower quality than my attempt). Taking this into consideration, will you then still argue it is inappropriate we do the same here at the English wikipedia for the Latvian article (in the version showcased by my )?   \n",

The \"\"aspects\"\" division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind. The perfect example is that of \"\"social conservatives\"\" who (can be) economically liberal without being socially liberal.\n",

I've no issue with you using IOC usage as the basis of a Manual of Style for various tables/articles etc, but in the places that specifically talk about the team name, or where the use of the BOA's own terminolology is relevant, but where you've been busily rewriting facts and removing sources you apparently just don't like, this is unnacceptable.   \"\n",

It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting. It sounds to me like reviews from GAMEST would be a great addition to Wikipedia for this reason.\n",
      "For articles on games created in non-English-language countries, I think it's also very helpful for a full grasp of the topic to include reception from the originating culture. So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too. If I happen to pick up any copies of it I'll try to add reviews from there as well. Cheers, -\n",

(I am not endorsing that site, but it just happens to be the one Chinese train schedule site that I am familiar with). As I query \"\"上海\"\" to \"\"南京\"\", the full list of trains shows up, including dozens of the new expensive G trains. The trains that arrive to Shanghai Railway Station are listed as coming to 上海 as expected. But - quite surprisingly - those trains (the majority of the G's) that I believe are going to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station are shown as arriving to some place called \"\"上海东\"\" (\"\"Shanghai East\"\") instead! So apparently this is how tielu.org chose to call the new Hongqiao Station... Moreover, Wuhan's two \"\"old\"\" stations, the Wuchang Railway Station and the Hankou Railway Station got new monikers as well - 武汉南 (\"\"Wuhan South\"\") and 武汉西 (\"\"Wuhan West\"\") respectively! (See e.g. the schedule for D3010, Wuchang - Shanghai Hongqiao, or, under tielu.org's new dispensation, \"\"Wuhan West - Shanghai East\"\". Now, I have used the tielu.org site long enough, and know that until quite recently Wuchang and Hankou always appeared there under their usual names, none of this \"\"Wuhan West\"\" / \"\"Wuhan South\"\" business.  A quick web search did not find anything particularly useful about this matter, other than a few people's comments on the 武汉南 label for the Wuchang Station on a discussion forum.  If anyone in the know reads this page - could he comment if this \"\"renaming\"\" is simply that website's own idea, or the \"\"new\"\" names have some official or semi-official status?

I was going to ask you if you could take over; if not, I'll ask at WT:GAN, but GAN can be a strange place at the moment and the quality of reviews seems to have slipped. As I'm aiming this at FAC, I'd appreciate a good reviewer.

The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs [37], and was proposed to \"\"make our neighborhoods safer\"\" [37] by producing more light, something that also increases [light pollution], while lowering [visual comfort probability].

It seems to mostly involve people calling and complaining - Complaints in San Diego held back further instillations along Harbor Drive, and the PR person I talked to said he had dealt with tons of complaints; And that was at an early stage of the upgrade. There's also a battle in Sacramento being waged to keep incandescent bulbs from being completely phased out (I wouldn't be surprised if it's not widely covered by the media), because they haven't come up with a non-toxic energy saving bulb (There actually was one being developed, and now I can't find any information about it). I know it to be controversial for many locals, but I can't provide online references, so I'm sticking to basic facts. (End Side Note)\n",
